            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All were indeed exempted, &amp; ſet free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the miſeries of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> but all entred not into the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Promiſe.</hi> For they who out of an hard hart became rebellious to my precepts, were as vngrateful perſons deſeruedly puniſhed &amp; taken out of this life: for he is not worthy of pardon, who contemneth his Lord and Maiſters commaund.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. O how much are thoſe Religious perſons deceiued, who thinke they haue ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied their vocation, if they charge not, nor ſtaine their conſcience with mortal ſins, and when they do any the very leaſt good worke, they thinke I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented ther with, and therupon, without further care or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ariuing to Perfection, they languiſh and become careleſſe in my ſeruice. But the cauſe ſtandeth not ſo: for I haue deliuered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from out the ſnares of the world, and out of the daunger of more grieuous faults, not for any other end, then that they may the more readily attayne to the perfection of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life, by ſeruing of me truly, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing my grace by the continuall exerciſe of holy actions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Certes, that man who out of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine careleſnes neglecteth to attaine to the perfection that I require of him, beſides this going backward, and fainting, pleaſeth me

                  <p n="6">6.

                  <p>SOME religious perſons do performe great matters. If they do them not moued out of a pure loue to me, they neither pleaſe me, nor am I bound to any remuneration for them: but if they do them for loue of me, yet with a languiſhing, and imperfect loue, they do not ſatisfie their profeſſion and vocation. So when I called thee out of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15101:12"/>
world, thou dideſt deliuer thy ſelfe wholy vnto me, and dideſt promiſe to do all for my loue, and I accepted this thy promiſe, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thee into my houſe, as one of myne, gaue thee my Liuery, prouided thee of all neceſſaries, and intreated and vſed thee as one moſt deare vnto me. And if thou now ſhalt haue a will to let ſome other enter into, and poſſeſſe thy hart, or to make this part common to another beſides me, thou ſhouldſt not indeed diſcharge the office and part of a perfect louer, ſith thou muſt not giue that to another, that thou haſt giuen to me already. For he who receyueth and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto himſelfe the thing againe, that he hath once giuen to another, either for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or to giue to another, is a theefe and worthy to be puniſhed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Haſt thou a deſire, my Sonne, to know, what religious perſon loueth me perfectly? Truly he doth it, who in all things, as well little as great, ſeeketh to do what pleaſeth me: who delayeth no tyme of executing my will ſo ſoone as he ſhall vnderſtand it: who doeth not only willingly obey my commandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but alſo manifeſteth a promptitude and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines in himſelfe, at the very leaſt ſigne or becke of my will. A perfect louer hath one and the ſame hart, and the ſame will with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15101:13"/>
the beloued, and therfore both hateth, and loueth what the beloued hateth or loueth. A perfect louer ſpareth no paynes nor trauaile, all wearines is ſweet vnto him, that he may accompliſh, what is pleaſing to the beloued. The perfect louer is not only wary and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant not to diſpleaſe the beloued in the very leaſt thing, but alſo is exceeding ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refull to pleaſe him more and more. He that laboureth not to affect and loue a thing as it deſerueth, either knoweth it not, or is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe iniurious vnto it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That religious man is far from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, who when he ſhall haue ſet his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp; care ouer much vpon things of litle regard, is much troubled, and lamenteth if I at any time procure, or cauſe the ſame to be remoued, or taken away from him. This is a ſigne of an imperfect louer, who loueth me more in words then in deeds. He doth indeed confeſſe in words, that he hath giuen himſelfe wholy vnto me, but his hart intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with diſſembled loue, holdeth him ſo faſt tyed, as if I would vſe myne owne right in wholy enioying it, &amp; thruſt out of it the loue of the very leaſt thing of all, it would eftſoones bee in trouble, and riſe againſt me. Many ſay, and brag that they loue me, but I only regard them, who loue me in works &amp;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15101:13"/>
verity. The tongue maketh no true and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere louers, but the works that haue their ſourſe and ſpring from a pious and deuout mind.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It remaineth now, that I ſhew vnto thee, what religious perſon ſerueth me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. He I ſay perfectly ſerueth me, who ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me of pure loue, though he ſhew it not by ſo great works: for what euer is done for loue of me, I eſteeme much, and will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly requite it. I make a greater recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a good worke, though very litle, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a burning loue, then of a great worke, accompanied with a meane meaſure of loue. Some weary themſelues out with taking exceeding great paynes, but with very little, or no profit at all to themſelues: for that the actions, though neuer ſo good, which be not ſealed vp with the ſeale of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, be not gratefull to me, and therfore they receiue not their hire: and if they be ſealed vp with a little ſeale, their reward is alſo little. Others in ſeruing me ſeeke after their owne commodities, wherof when they ſhall ſee but a little hope, they pull their hand backe from their accuſtomed labours of ſeruing me, &amp; do excuſe the ſame through weaknes of body or of mind: but indeed there is nothing that maketh them afraid,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15101:14"/>
but their owne will, and the abſence of thoſe commodities they had hoped for.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He ſerueth amiſſe, who in ſeruing ſeeketh to profit himſelfe: for ſuch an one ſerueth not me, but himſelfe, &amp; therfore he doth in vaine expect any reward fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me. He that will not for loue of me diſcommodate himſelfe, neither is my ſeruant, neither do I hold him worthy the name of a ſeruant. A good ſeruant is nothing afraid to ſuffer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities for his Lord and Maiſter, and this is to be truely a ſeruant. My Ghoſpell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth, that a ſeruant ought to be not only faithful, but alſo wiſe: for he is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to accommodate himſelfe to the will, &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his Maiſter, and he muſt not ſeek, that his Lord accommodate himſelfe to his will. He cannot poſſibly ſerue another, who hath a will to liue at his owne pleaſure, and as he liſteth himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Many religious perſons liue diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with their ſot in religion, and that they muſt not impute to me, but to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.

                  <p>VVHITHER ſoeuer Lord, I turne my ſelfe, I find cauſes of feare. For if I examine the benefit of my vocation to Religion, I conceyue it to be ſo noble and excellent, as I muſt confeſſe my ſelfe far vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to render thanks for it. If I looke into my ſelfe, I find ſo great an imbecillity, and daſtardy, as I am afraid leaſt I ſhould be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med moſt vngratefull. Againe the greatnes of thy maieſty confoundeth me, being ſuch and ſo great, as no ſatisfaction can poſſibly be made vnto thee, but by a certaine infinit loue, and ſeruing of thee, which is more then I can, or am able to do. Who then would not be afraid?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Out of queſtion my Sonne, I beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed a great benefit vpon thee, when I tooke thee out of the ſtormy Ocean of the world, and placed thee in the quiet harbour of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It is alſo certaine, that of this benefit there ariſeth an obligation, and that by ſo much the greater, by how much the benefit was great. But for this thou haſt not any
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15101:19"/>
iuſt cauſe to feare: ſith I am he, who do communicate to all, competent grace and forces, towards the ſatisfying of their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, ſo they be not ſlacke and negligent of themſelus, but do put to their owne hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hand, as much as they are able. And it is my ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of old to be rather more franke and liberall in beſtowing of benefits, then ſeuere in exacting obligations and debts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Neither is there cauſe, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of my Maieſty ſhould put into thee any feare, or confuſion, ſo thou be not wanting on thy part in louing and ſeruing me; not ſo much as my worthines requireth, but as thine owne forces be of ability to beare, ſith I haue neuer exacted more of a man, then he can well do. That perſon hath indeed iuſt cauſe to feare, who when he is able doth not what he ought, and is required of him to do.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is but one thing for thee greatly to be afraid of, and that is, that thou offend not me thy benefactour by ſome greiuous ſinne, who of my ſingular grace haue raiſed thee vp to ſo high an eſtate of holy life, and am ready to raiſe thee higher, if thou be not a let therunto thy ſelfe. That religious man offendeth me moſt of all, who thinketh that he may liue a more holy life in the world, then in religion, &amp; that is the cauſe he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:15101:20"/>
maketh ſo light eſteeme of the benefit of his vocation. For he who affoardeth me little honour, reſpect, and ſeruice in myne owne houſe, will not doubtles yeald me greater where my enemies haue to do. This is a manifeſt and notable abuſe and deceit, and the very origen of all perturbation. For if a man could ſerue me more perfectly in the world, I would neuer haue inuited him to religion. All good proceedeth from me: I wiſh and counſaile true and ſolid perfection to all, and I know beſt, what moſt profiteth and is neceſſary for euery one towards the attayning of his ſaluation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A religious man muſt not caſt his eyes vpon that which beſt pleaſeth him, and highly preferre it before another thing, as more excellent; but what ſhall pleaſe me. Thoſe alſo offend me ſorely, who when in religion they obtaine not all things as they liſt, or haue their part in ſome diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, do eaſily murmure, and as it were ſorrowing and greiued that they haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the world, do thinke a religious life hard, and painefull. So were ſome of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> affected, when they were out of <hi>Aegipt.</hi> For ſo ſoone as they began to want their former commodities, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the troubleſome labours of trauayling,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15101:20"/>
they murmured; &amp; reflecting vpon the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> they wiſhed themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in their former bondage. I did not call them out to reſt, but to take paines; neither did I appoint them recreations, and great commodities of life, but from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning diligently inculcated, that many things were to be endured for Chriſt, &amp; that the fleſh is to be mortified, togeather with the deſires therof: and this condition they accepted, and vndertooke to performe. What cauſe then haue they to complaine? And though none of all this had happened, yet if their Lord ſuffered ſo great matters for them, what great thing ſhall they do, if they alſo being ſeruants, ſhall ſuffer ſomewhat for their Lord?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A religious man, who is afraid to ſuffer any thing, looſeth his reward, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a man muſt needs ſuffer many things, if the labour and affliction be doubled, it maketh the burden the more intollerable. Others make light eſteeme of Religion their Mother, for that they thinke themſelues not bound to their religion, but their religion to them. But they are deceyued. For if they examine the matter well, they ſhal find that they haue receyued very many benefits of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and religion none at all by them. For
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15101:21"/>
to be religious and Gods feruant, is ſo noble a gift of God, and of Religion, as it ought worthily to be preferred before all the good works, that are done for religion. For there is not any earthly dignity in the world, that may enter into compariſon with the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of religious life. It is an argument of a baſe and vnthankeful mind, if a religious perſon buſy himſelfe rather in thinking vpon the commodityes that he hath brought to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, then thoſe that he hath receyued from it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Againe that religious man diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me not a little, who careth not how he imployeth the talent he hath receyued of me: for by that he manifeſteth, what ſmall reckoning he maketh of it, and hath no will to ſatisfy his office, when he may, &amp; is able. How many be there, who being able to my great pleaſure, do vndergoe ſome exerciſe for the good and helping of ſoules, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee they be not able to do them with ſo great applauſe, as ſome others can, they giue them cleane ouer. Is not this an ambitious prid? Is not this to hide the talent vnder ground, which I gaue him to make his gaine therwith? I cannot be ignorant, what is good and healthfull for euery one, and therfore I giue fiue talents to ſome, two
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15101:21"/>
to others, &amp; but one to another. And though to negotiate with one talent, doth not cary ſo great applauſe and credit amongſt men, as to negotiate and trafficke with fiue, yet it is not ſo with me. For I conſider not, how much euery one negotiateth, but how well and carefully. And if to negotiate with the help of many talents, ſhould redound to the ſoules good of many, and to the greater glory of my name, it would be a worke worthy of commendation.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But this is that which I find fault withall, that many haue a deſire to haue many talents, and much negotiation, that they may be the more admired at, and the better eſteemed of men, whiles to me, the authour of all good, they leaue either no place at al, or very litle. My beloued ſeruants did not ſo at other times, who aſcribed the imperfections and lapſes to themſelues, and the fruit of their good works to me, &amp; that they might transfer the praiſe and glory of all their labours to me, they would be ſaid to be vnprofitable ſeruants: for the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of an excellent worke returneth not to the inſtrument that wrought it, but to the crafteſman himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Sonne, of the contempt of thy voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or religious profeſſion, there groweth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:15101:22"/>
another euill, and that is a negligence, or careleſnes of attayning the end of thy voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a neglect of obſeruing the rules of thy proper Inſtitute. And this vice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth me ſo highly, as I am forced euen to puniſh ſuch perſons in this preſent life.

And if they by neglecting and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all this, reape no fruit of their good works at all; what meruayle, though like vnto the accurſed fig-tree, that did indeed beare leaues, but yet no fruit at al, they ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times decay, and wither away. The trees that I haue planted in a religious garden, ought continually to yeald the fruite of good workes; els as vnprofitable, they are to be accurſed, and being once withered are to be throwne into hell fire.

Moreouer a Religious man is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and is not far from daunger of leauing his vocation, who thinketh, that he may be able to do more good in the world, then in Religion.

With theſe fraudes the diuell vſeth to draw the vnwary Religious man into his net. For when he ſhall once haue perſwaded him, that he may do more, and more excellent works in the world, he forth with ſuggeſteth that no great reckoning is to be made of the ſtate of Religion, and ſo in concluſion dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him from his vocation.

What doth it profit a man to be nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well armed, if at the time when by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of his Captaine Generall he were to fight with his enemie, he ſhould not vſe them? The tree that yealdeth no fruit, is to no purpoſe ſuffred to ſtand in an orchard, ſith it is for no other end planted there, then for the bearing of fruite. I haue taken vp all religious perſons to ſerue me in my warre, &amp; haue giuen them weapons and armes, that they may vſe them, as I would haue them. And therefore whoſoeuer glorieth in the name of a Religious man, and ſheweth not by deed his loue towards me, nor doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to the ſpirit of his vocation yeald me ſpirituall fruite, he doth not the office &amp; part of a Religious man.</p>

O how far are they deceiued, who thinke themſelues to haue diſcharged their duty well, for that they haue entred into the ſtate of religion, and continued therin, often reckoning the number of the yeares, which they haue liued in it, &amp; not examining how negligent they haue beene in the exerciſe of pious works, and how little fruit and profit they haue reaped by their labours &amp; paynes. The number of yeares maketh not a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man happy, but his good works, and the

exerciſe of vertues. To glory of the great continuance in religion, and to be deuoid of vertue, and the perfection therof, is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation at all, but a reproach and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>

But he is wholy deceyued, neither am I content ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with alone: for he who thinketh he may make a ſtand heere, doth not a little offend me.

And though it conſiſt of diuers parts, yet haue I ſo knit them togeather in one body, as they make a well ordered army, ſeruing happily vnder
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:15101:29"/>
my Croſſes ſtandard. And in this my Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches army the ſquadron of Religious men marcheth in the vanguard, whoſe charge it is with the inuincible help of ſpirituall arms to gayne &amp; make a conqueſt of the kingdome of Heauen. This battalion according to the diuerſity of Religions, hath differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t colours, and yet all haue their directions from me the Generall of the whole Army. Euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man alſo muſt ſerue vnder thoſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and in that Company wherin he was firſt enrolled, euen vntill his death, and muſt exerciſe himſelfe in thoſe armes that are proper to his order, or religion. It helpeth much, if he be well affected to his owne Order. For the ſouldier that is well affected to his colours, doth not eaſily chang or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, but when need is ventureth his life alſo for the defence therof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though all Religions commonly ayme at this, that they may make their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects perfect in my ſeruice, yet euery one hath certaine proper and peculiar exerciſes, wherby to become perfect in their one: and this is the ſpecialll end and ſcope, that all thoſe who imbrace the ſame, ought to propoſe vnto themſelues. For example: they who imbrace the religion, that profeſſeth a ſolitary life, remoted and retired from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:15101:29"/>
with men, as is that of Ermites, ought to labour to become perfect in cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in dyet, in contemplation of heauenly things, and in the praiſing of God. And ſuch as haue entred into a religion that profeſſeth an actiue life, that is, to help their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours both ſpiritually and corporally, ought to profit in the exerciſe that is proper to an actiue life, that is, in exerciſing charity to their neighbours, with as much paynes and care as they are able, without any the leaſt regard of their owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity, but meerly for my glory, knowing that whatſoeuer they ſhall do to their neighbour for loue of me, they ſhall do it to me, and that I will be their reward for it. The ſame muſt they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo do who imbrace a religion that attendeth to Contemplation, that they may the more entirely vnite themſelues with God their maker; and that alſo which mixeth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation with Action, ſuch as be commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And theſe particuler exerciſes can neither be well done, nor continued long, vnles they that practiſe them, endeauour to that perfection of life, that is common to all religious perſons; that is, vnles they ſeek and labour to deny their owne will, to mortify their ſenſes, and to contemne themſelues.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:15101:30"/>
For of theſe vertues, as of foundations, the ſpeciall and proper exerciſes of euery Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion do conſiſt, and are by them ſupported. He that is good, &amp; perfect in himſelfe, may eaſily help others to become good alſo, which he cannot wel do, if he ſhal not be good him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For he, who hath no care of his owne perfection, cannot wel promote it in others. Who is naught to himſelfe, to whome will he be good?</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:15101:36"/>
which we dayly find in the ſpirituall life, which doth ſo moleſt and trouble vs in the way of perfection, as they either diſturbe &amp; hinder it quite, or at leaſt lay a barre againſt it, that it ſucceed not ſo well.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wherfore that we proceed more ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to mount vp to the perfection of vertues, wheron is placed the ſeate of Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in the firſt place this is the cauſe, that we do not ſeriouſly reſolue with our ſelues to haue a will to vſe all our forces to get vp to the top of this mountaine: and this proceedeth of nothing els, then that we do not effectually labour to get perfection. He that effectually deſireth health, careth not what medicine be giuen vnto him: This defect is ſuch, as it cutteth off cleane all hope of arryuing to perfection. For he that hath not made a firme purpoſe to hold on in the way to perfection, will hardly begin to pace towards it: and he who beginneth not, how is it poſſible for him to come to his prefixed end? And he that is ſo affected in mind, when he neglecteth the occaſion of doing well, will either do no good at all, or will fall to what is worſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. O how great a loſſe of ſpirituall gaine ſuſtayneth that religious man, who prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his iourney in the way of perfection!
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:15101:36"/>
He will no doubt at the houre of death bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderſtand this errour then now he doth: for in that exact and laſt examen of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he ſhall more clearely ſee, that he had no iuſt cauſe of differring the exerciſe of vertues, but that it was pretermitted of him through his owne meer careleſnes and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. And his grief and confuſion will at that time be the greater, the more he had his part in my inſpirations, wherby I did ſo often inuite him, ſtir him vp, and ſollicited him to perfection.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is another impediment alſo to a Religious man, that maketh him with the more difficulty to labour to perfection, becauſe he apprehendeth it for an ouer great difficulty to obtaine victory ouer himſelfe, and to ouercome the bad affections of his mind. But as delay made without cauſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth the mind, and very much hurteth a man: ſo an effectuall, and cheerfull reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vndergoing a thing, greatly helpeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ouercomming of any difficulty.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Son, if thou wert the firſt of thoſe who ſhould enter into the way of this warfare, thou mightſt haue ſome cauſe &amp; excuſe, but ſince there haue been ſo many, who though ſometimes ouercome, did yet in the end victoriouſly get vp to the top of the hil, thou
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15101:37"/>
canſt pretend no cauſe of excuſe at all, or of pardon. For the obtayning of a victory and Crowne it is not inough to fight, but a man muſt go away alſo with the victory.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is yet another vice, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth vs from getting vp to the mount of perfection, for that we are fettered in faſt bands at the foot of the hil. And whoſoeuer is ſo tyed, he may indeed moue himſelfe a little, but mount vp he well cannot. That Religious man is much deceiued. who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly affected to ſome humane thing, thinketh that he may ariue to perfection. For whereas he holdeth his hart, faſt tyed with the cord of affection to ſome thing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he muſt needs either mount vp the hill without an hart, which is not poſſible, and would not be pleaſing to God; or els without life with the thing created, to which he clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth faſt, which God would neuer indeed tolerate, who hath neuer ſuffred any thing to be beloued togeather with himſelfe. For ſith he is of himſelfe, &amp; of his owne nature good, his wil is alſo to be beloued alone by himſelf. The Creatour cannot loue him, who againſt his will transferreth his loue to a creature.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. An impediment alſo to the ſame aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, is the ouer ſore burden, that a man layeth vpon his owne ſhoulders. For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15101:37"/>
he muſt go an hard and painefull way, the more he is ſurcharged and loaden, the leſſer and ſhorter iourneyes maketh he, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles he is ſtayed in the midde way, and cannot go any further. Wherfore a religious man, who intangleth himſelfe in many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires and imployments that nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne his vocation, will either trauaile ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the mount of perfection, or will be forced to ſtay in his way thitherward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtrength of his ſpirit is weake, the way painefull and vneuen, and the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his mind eſtranged from ſuch a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or rather inclined to the contrary. A Religious man hath inough to carry his one burden, which if he ſhal increaſe with other mens cares, no meruaile though he yeald and fall vnder the burden, and oftentimes come to that miſery, that he is not able to beare his owne, and much leſſe anothers.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Finally it is not the leaſt impediment of getting vp to the top of the hill, for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man to be moued with too much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration of himſelfe. If one haue a dull horſe, and out of pitty dareth not giue him the ſpurre, probably he will not come to the end of his iourney. I like not of a religious man, that is ouer nice and delicate, who leaſt he ſhould put his body to ſome paines, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:15101:38"/>
not to perfection, as he ſhould do. The ſouldier, who hath ouer much care of ſauing his life, and an horrour of the dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers of war, doth ordinarily but make vp the number, &amp; giueth no increaſe to the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the army at all: for when there is occaſion preſented him of ſhewing his valour &amp; cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, he runneth away for feare.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Religious, who are now crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in heauen, did not ſo. For though they were of a weake body by nature, and had accuſtomed it to all manner of eaſe and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, yet after they once became Religious, for the attayning of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they puniſhed it with faſting, pennance and mortification, and ſo with commendation and merit arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to that which they ſought for. That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man, who fauoureth his body more, then meete is, loueth it too much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knoweth not how to loue it truly, like vnto an ouer mild Phiſitian, who by his curing increaſeth the ſicknes.</p>

                  <p>SONN, in ſome Religious perſons there be found other imperfections and defects, which as they do no leſſe hinder Perfection,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:15101:38"/>
then the former, ſo be they no leſſe diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto me. The firſt is, that they will not labour to perfection by the common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, but do bethinke and deuiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other new way, vnknowne to their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers. But they erre very ſore in the matter: for where it is of it ſelfe very hard &amp; pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to get vp to the mount of perfection, the paine would be doubled, if a new way beſids the ordinary be to be taken: neither doth the crafty enemy ſeeke any other thing, then to hinder a mans endeauour of climing vp, by adding a new labour and paine in doing it. Who goeth on in the beaten way, trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſecurely: for that they who went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by their example ſhewed the ſecurity of it, and of this ſecurity he hath no ſigne at al, who goeth and ſeeketh out a new way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. O in how great an errour be thoſe Religious perſons, who reiecting and negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the ordinary ſpirit of their owne Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, do follow and imbrace another par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, &amp; ſtrange ſpirit. This is to go a new way, both with more labour, and leſſe profit. For it commonly hapneth, that ſuch men whiles they find not an end of their way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſhamed of themſelues, are forced to go backe againe, or els do fall headlong into ſome pittfall or other. That religious man
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:15101:39"/>
cannot be guided by Gods ſpirit, who refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to keep the way, which all thoſe that went before him held. I haue appointed to euery religion a certaine and determinate way, ordayning to that end peculiar laws &amp; conſtitutions, declaring the manner and meanes, how euery man may come to his iourneys end. He therfore, who ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect his way, and go another, doth plainly giue to vnderſtand, that I haue not inſtituted euery religion wiſely inough to content him. And heere is to be ſeene a notable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and tricke of the Prince of darknes, who leadeth the negligent and vnwary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſons out of the common way of their owne inſtitut, that when they are once wearyed in it, he may caſt them downe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to their further ruine.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A ſecond defect is, that they will not vſe the guide, whome I haue giuen to direct them in the way without errour. For that trauaylour is not without cauſe deemed te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarious and raſh, who goeth his iourney without a guide, which he knoweth, by reaſon of the many turnings and by-wayes, to be ſubiect to many daungers &amp; ſtrayings out of the way. I am the guid, who to al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men do ſhew the right way to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And I do it by Superiours, &amp; ſpiritual
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:15101:39"/>
Fathers, whome I haue appointed in euery religion. Wherefore it is no meruaile though they, who will not ſuffer themſelues to be gouerned and directed by their Superiours and ghoſtly fathers, but follow their owne iudgment, ſtray out of the way, be ſpoiled by theeues, or fall into miſery and ruine. So hapneth it vnto thoſe, who before they be ſchollers, do profeſſe themſelues to be mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and ſo by a ſecret pride, wherby they contemne their ſuperiour whome I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for their directour and maiſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſchollers of the Diuell, who is the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and chief leader of all the proud.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A third defect there is, ariſing of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reſpect; namely, that ſome be ouer ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litous to gaine the good will and fauour of all. Is the care of a religious perſon to pleaſe men, and not to diſpleaſe the world? Vpon what true ground, or reaſon can he ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the worlds fauour, who hath once ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly abandoned and giuen ouer the world? I called him therfore out of the world to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that he might not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>eke any thing, but to pleaſe me alone, &amp; in that way to hold on towards perfection. If by the help of this world a man might be brought to a perfect ſtate, a religious man might alſo vſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and help therof: but it is not ſo. For
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15101:40"/>
the world followeth a far other profeſſion, and intertayneth other manner of cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then thoſe of attayning ſpiritual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Who ſtudyeth, and hath a care to pleaſe men, is no diſciple of mine, neither pleaſeth he me, nor do I intertaine him for my ſeruant.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A man can ſerue but one maiſter, with true loue. And if he would deuide his hart into two parts, let him not determine to offer me the one of them: for I will in no ſort accept it. If thou haſt ſo great a deſire to pleaſe men, wherfore didſt thou leaue them? O miſerable religious man, who when thou liuedſt ſtill in the world, didſt not only not hunt after the fauours of men, but alſo didſt not any thing that might obſcure thy good name and eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but after the time thou haſt imbraced a religious eſtate, thou burnſt with a deſire of pleaſing men, in ſo much as thou art not aſhamed to do many things, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thy vocation and condition, and which is worſt of all, grieuouſly alſo to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me, leaſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

looſeſt the peace and quiet of thy mind? This is not, I muſt tell thee, the way to the mount of perfection, but to the downe-fall, &amp; pitt of eternall damnation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is yet another impediment in attayning to the perfection of vertues, to wit when a religious man obſerueth no order or good proceeding in his ſpirituall actions. An army, though neuer ſo great, complete, and prouided of all neceſſaryes, if it be not well ordred, either when it marcheth, or when it ioyneth in battaile with the enemy, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer get the victory: So a religious man, who muſt contend and fight for the getting of Perfection, that is ſeated vpon an high hill, and compaſſed with all complete armour of vertues, if he obſerue no order in all his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall exerciſes and actions, which be as it were ſo many ſouldiers, ſhall neuer go away with the victory.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There be ſome, who before they haue layd the foundation of humility, begin to raiſe their ſpirituall building. Others againe before they be paſt the Purgatiue way, think they may be moſt inwardly conioyned, and vnited with me. But this is not the way &amp; courſe of comming to perfection. Humility muſt be procured in the firſt place, and from it a paſſage muſt be made to pennance, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:15101:41"/>
by it the mind and conſcience is throughly to be cleanſed. It is not inough for him, who falleth into the myre, to riſe out of it, vnles he alſo waſh away all the durt: euen ſo it is not inough, that a religious man hath renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and forſaken the world, and to haue gotten out of the ſinke of ſinne, but he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth further to extirpate his bad inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and hurtfull affections and propenſions, which remayne as ſtaynes behind in the ſoule, and in place of them by the help of my illuminating grace to plant moſt beautifull vertues: ſo doing he may aduenture to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moſt in ward, and moſt familiar with me.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Laſtly, an Inconſtancy in ſpirituall life ſtoppeth vp, and debarreth the entrance not only to perfection, but alſo the meanes of compaſſing any vertue at all. For there be thoſe, who endeauour often to get vp to the mount of perfection, but they ſtill fall down againe into the valley that lyeth vnder it, becauſe they are more prone to abandon and giue ouer the thing they haue once begon, then they be manfull to go through with it. O how much ſhall they be afflicted for this their inconſtancy, when the houre of their death ſhall be at hand, when the Diuell ſhall vpbraid them with this, that they did
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:15101:41"/>
indeed with great feruour wreſt from their Superiours, frequent exerciſe and vſe of prayer, faſting, diſciplines, and other morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications for their profit of ſpirit, &amp; for their helps to perfection; but afterwards they did none of them at all, or very little.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. If a Religious man had as great loue to perfection, as he ſhould haue, he would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer aſpire and labour to it, neither ſhould there occur any difficulty, that might terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy him from compaſſing it. But becauſe his loue languiſheth in the thing it ſelfe, whence that inconſtancy groweth, he eaſily relen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and recoyleth. A Religious man, doth not only ſuffer the loſſe of time by tryfling thus, but alſo becommeth worſe euery day, then other.</p>

                  <p>LORD, if it be ſo hard and painefull a matter to arriue to perfection, by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſo many defects &amp; impediments, that ſtop vp the way; I ſee not how I, that am moſt weake, can come thither, or ouercome ſo many difficultyes with my moſt ſlender forces. Sonne, he that reſolueth ſeriouſly &amp; hartily to labour to perfection, doth moſt certainly arriue vnto it. So many Religious
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:15101:42"/>
men in former times moſt perfect, who now enioy their euerlaſting felicity in heauen, were me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like vnto thee, &amp; had the ſame diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultyes that thou haſt, and much greater, &amp; yet they manfully and conſtantly ouercame them, and thou mayſt do as much, if thou wilt. Neither ſhalt thou want my grace and help, as they neither wanted, ſo thou reſolue vpon ſome thing, as they did. Neither muſt thou be diſcouraged and recoyle for feare of the difficultyes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>at will encounter thee, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſeing there be as many and more meanes, wayes, and remedyes for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and taking away of thoſe difficultyes, and procuring of perfection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The firſt remedy is, with an inward affection to imbrace perfection, &amp; earneſtly to labour therin, ſith for the ouercoming of all the rockes of this mountaine there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, or more effectuall then the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of loue. Neither is there any thing that inciteth a Religious man more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue on his way, and to labour to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, then the ſame. Of loue there then followeth a deſire, and care of vſing and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting thoſe meanes, that be neceſſary or profitable towards the attayning of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And ſtudy, care, &amp; diligence do help very much towards the more ſpeedy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15101:42"/>
of what is deſired or loued. Of the ſame loue groweth conſtancy and perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, wherby ſpirit, life, and hart is giuen a religious man to hold on, and to proſecute his labours, and of this next followeth the victory, and crowne. To him who loueth nothing is hard, no not the ouercoming and gayning of heauen; and the getting vp to the top of the mount of perfection</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A ſecond remedy, and meanes to the attayning of perfection is, to haue a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and regard euen of our very leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. Some are wont, when they fal into ſuch manner of imperfections, to breake forth into theſe, or the like words: It maketh no matter, it is a thing of little moment, it is nothing: and theſe men be the very bane of religion. For of this conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt they become in time bold, temerarious, raſh, &amp; by their own bad example they draw others to a certaine pernicious and diſſolute liberty. That muſt not be held in light eſteeme, that diſpleaſeth me: neither ought it to be thought a ſmall matter, which I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund, or forbid, though it be not great indeed in it ſelfe. And know thou, my Sonne, that the very leaſt imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions pleaſe me not, &amp; for that cauſe I haue forbidden them. Know thou further, that the religious man who maketh a conſcience
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15101:43"/>
to tranſgreſſe or offend in the very leaſt things, is deliuered from greater imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. For all the great ruyne, and breaches of good order and diſcipline, that are found in religion, haue receiued their beginning of ſmaller faults. Who ſhutteth his eyes at a light fall, will alſo ſhut them at a greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that prepareth the way therto, that is, a ſmaller to a greater.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A Third, and very good means alſo is, for a man to mortify himſelfe in the very leaſt things. For religious perfection com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all vertues; all which a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be poſſeſſed off, vnles he get a full &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute commaund ouer his paſſions &amp; ſenſes. And a man commaundeth his paſſions, if he reſtrayne them ſo ſoone, as they raiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the reaſon, or againſt the laws of religion: neither muſt he alſo yeald vnto the ſenſes euen in the leaſt matters, more then is fitting to his religious eſtate. For he who condeſcendeth to his ſenſes, beyond the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity of vertue, ſoone findeth them rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious; and he who doth not reſiſt his inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate paſſions in the beginning, becometh a ſlaue vnto them in the end.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A fourth meanes and way to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not only auaylable, but alſo neceſſary, is, that a religious mans mind euer conſpire,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15101:43"/>
and accord with his Superiours will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in all things. For all helps haue their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen from me, which are needful towards the attayning of perfection, &amp; them I ordinarily communicate by the Superiours, by whom I do enlighten and gouerne my ſubiects. Whereupon ſuch a one as is ſeparated from his Superiours, wanteth ſuch kind of gifts, and helps. And more then that, he is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from me; and therfore no meruayle though he fall often, be troden vnder other mens feet, be contemned, and pyne way and languiſh, becauſe he is a dead member cut off from the head. It little auayleth the ſcholler to go vnto the ſchoole, if he be not one with his maiſter, by whome he may be directed in his courſe of learning and ſtudyes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Finally, it helpeth not a little to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, if theſe wayes be practiſed, not with a tediouſnes, &amp; heauines of mind, but with promptitude and alacrity. For this alacrity profiteth much to the ouercoming of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultyes, which the body apprehendeth and feeleth in the attayning of vertues: it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth the enemies that oppoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to conſerue this ſpirituall ioy and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes in mounting vp to this hill of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, a man muſt haue companions in his iourney. It cannot be ſaid, how much vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and profit a religious man receyueth by the company and conuerſation of the good, by whoſe ſpeach, and example he may be excited and ſtirred vp to deuotion, ſith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there is, that in humane life hath more force to moue a man to perfection, then the example of good vertuous compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>

                  <p>SONNE, the ſpirituall ioy, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that a good Religious man hath after he is entred into the narrow way of perfection, is no doubt great, and ſingular, as on the contrary, the grief and heauines of hart that oppreſſeth a bad religious man, holding on in the broad way of imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, is hard, diſguſtfull, and bitter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the one and the other beginneth in this life, to haue a taſte of that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them in the other, either puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or reward. Lord, I know not, what I may anſwere to this: for I ſee many Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men to imbrace the broad way, &amp; not to labour greatly to come to perfection, and yet to be very iocand, cheerfull, and merry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Son, thou art deceiued. For in the way of liberty, and where no obſeruation of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is in practiſe, there is not any true or ſolid ioy, though it may ſeeme to be ſuch. A
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:15101:48"/>
Religious man who liueth at his owne wil and as he pleaſeth, diſpleaſeth others, and he oftentimes is caſt downe with grief, &amp; pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuenes, becauſe he cannot haue what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth him. True ioy hath the ſeate in the mind, and ariſeth of the peace and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of conſcience, which is felt within; which cannot be in the religious man, who leadeth a free and diſſolute life, becauſe his mind is day by day, as a ſea, toſſed and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the ſurges and waues of perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; paſſions. Woe be to a religious man, reioycing in his imperfections.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There be others in religion, who runne the way to perfection after their own will; neither vſe that moderation in morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying themſelues, that were to be required. Theſe men do often ſtumble in their way, becauſe they preiudice, and hurt their health, and yet they ariue not to that holines of life, whereunto they labour. And whereas they be deſtitute of ioy and comfort, both from within and without, all the fault is aſcribed to ouermuch deuotion, which is no ſuch matter. For it is not deuotion, that cauſeth either infirmity, or anguiſh of mind, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion, and that more is done and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, then reaſon dictateth, or I require. None can be either his own guide, or iudge.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:15101:48"/>4. But true peace and ioy, is to be found in thoſe religious men, who do with due moderation attend to perfection, &amp; practiſe the meanes of coming vnto it, by the aduiſe, direction, and preſcripts of Superiours, and ſpirituall Fathers. For what way ſoeuer they turne themſelues, they euer find occaſions of being glad, and of reioicing ſpiritually. If they conuert themſelues to me, they haue no want of conſolation, becauſe they know wel inough, how much it pleaſeth me to ſee a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man, labouring earneſtly towards perfection. And if there were not any thing els in this life, it were and ought alone to be inough for a religious man, to paſſe ouer his life in an exceeding ioy. For a ſeruant cannot haue any greater pleaſure and contentment, then to vnderſtand, that all his offices, and ſeruices be pleaſing vnto his Lord. And if they turne their eyes to their Superiours, they experience the ſame by tranquillity of mind. For ſeeing they be ſtudious and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous perfection, they muſt needs be quiet, peaceable, obedient, moſt obſeruant of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſcipline, and conſequently in high eſteeme and beloued of their Superiours; which if they once get knowledge off, they cannot but reioyce greatly.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Now if we looke vpon others, with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:15101:49"/>
whom they liue &amp; keep company, they haue no cauſe of grief at al. For ſeeing they attend to the exerciſe of vertue, they hinder or hurt none, but haue a care to do good to all, as to themſelues, and therefore they intertayne peace with all: and where peace is, there is true ioy. And more then that, vertue maketh them amiable, not only to their friends, but to their enemyes alſo. For the vertuous are beloued, honoured, and reſpected of all, in ſo much that a religious man can neuer want internall conſolation and comfort. Againe if they conſider themſelues, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without conſolation alſo. For it is proper to vertue, wherein they exerciſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to worke with pleaſure and taſte, and therfore needs it muſt be, that true Religious perſons reioyce in all their actions: yea they find conſolation in their tribulations, and perſecutions, when they be ready for loue of me, euen to ſuffer and endure the paynes of hell, if it could be without their owne fault and would be for my glory; and not only that, but all the aduerſities and miſeries of this world beſids.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Finally the meditation of death, which ſtricketh a feare and horrour into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to good religious men is an occaſion and matter of ioy, not only for the reward,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:15101:49"/>
that they expect, but becauſe they ſhall then haue their part of that exceeding and ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing conſolation, which they attend for at the houre of death, for the care and deſire, they had in arriuing to perfection. For the ſoule will at that time be exceedingly glad, neither ſhall ſhe be able to find an end of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thanks for receyued benefits.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There is but one thing, that can make a good Religious man ſad, &amp; that is, if he fal into ſome imperfection. But this ſorrow cannot be of continuance, becauſe it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly taken away by the vertue of penna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and the fault cancelled by contrition, and vpon this the mind is put againe in poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the former tranquility. Tell me now my Sonne, who peraduenture makſt but little eſteeme of perfection, in what other thing mayſt thou find ſo great and vniuerſal a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of mind? What thing can ſecure thy mind more, or better, then the deſire of of perfection? Conſidereſt thou not, that to labour &amp; attend to perfection, is nothing els, then beforehand to take an eſſay, &amp; that of eternall felicity? Thou muſt needs be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if thou robbe and ſpoile thy ſelfe of ſo great a good, that thou need not take any paines in reſtrayning and conquering the deſires of thy fleſh, and ſenſes. And this
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:15101:50"/>
madnes will appeare the more euident vnto thee, when there will not be oportunity for thee to do that, which now thou ſhouldſt do. Happy is he, who ſhall in that laſt ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be able to ſay: Whatſoeuer good I could, or ought to do, that, by the fauour of Gods grace, I haue done in my life time.</p>

Euery euill is wont to be the more dangerous, the leſſe it is knowne: for if it be by careleſnes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected in the beginning, it increaſeth, &amp; by little and little gathereth ſo great force and ſtrength, as in the end it exerciſeth a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund ouer all. O how much doth a bad religious man hurt himſelfe! who tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and carryed away by an ouer great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of liuing, looketh not into himſelfe,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:15101:50"/>
that he may vnderſtand, whence ſo ſore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations &amp; afflictions which he endureth in religion, haue their beginning.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If he turne himſelfe to me, he is aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: for he knoweth, that he was called out of the world, to lead a ſeparated, retyred, and perfect life: and he knoweth how many benefits I haue beſtowed vpon him; &amp; how great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modityes I haue giuen him towards the proſecution and practiſe of vertue. And that by neglecting them, he hath left off all cogitation of labouring to perfection, and ſeeketh alwayes to line at more liberty, and to ſatisfie the allureme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the ſenſes. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth me as much, as his ingratitude is hatefull vnto me, whence ſuch a life procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Theſe be not thoſe pious and good purpoſes, that he made, and gaue teſtimony of, at his firſt entrance into religion: neither is this the way that I taught him, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I walked my ſelfe. Neither can he but know in his own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, that this his life (which is far from that of a religious man) diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenteth me greatly. And therfore he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his wil, inwardly torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with moſt bitter ſtings of conſcience, though outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſhew it not; and when time co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, ſhall receiue his deſerued puniſhment. The ſeruant, who is priuy to his maiſters will, &amp;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:15101:51"/>
doth it not whiles he is able, if he be not a very foole, meriteth ſeuerely to be puniſhed for it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If he hath to deale with his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, he is much afflicted, and troubled. For ſith he is neither obedient, nor loueth reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſcipline, it is not in him to keep common peace with them, and therfore it muſt needs be, that many things be in like manner done, that be one while diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to himſelfe, and otherwhiles to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours. Beſides that, the poore &amp; compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Superiours be grieued, not knowing how they may deale with him, that he may be holpen. For if they deale fauourably &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an indulgent ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner with him, he being accuſtomed to liberty, abuſeth their gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes, and becometh the more proud. If they handle him with more ſeuerity, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him to do his duty; then as one impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of ſo hard diſcipline, he ſhaketh off the yoake therof, and troubleth the Religion. If any thing be commaunded him, he refuſeth to do it: if pennance be inioyned him, he complaineth and murmureth. That he liue ſo ſtill amongſt the reſt after his owne will, is nothing expedient: for the longer the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of doing ill is continued, the worſe it maketh the man, and by his bad example
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:15101:51"/>
he hurteth &amp; miſleadeth the more. Whence it followeth, that a Religious man, who contemning the deſire of perfection, liueth diſorderly, and maketh no reckoning of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayning peace with Superiours, muſt needs be troubled with a continuall heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and bitternes of mind. Certes, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be bad, &amp; become euery day worſe then other, who contradicteth and reſiſteth his Superiours and betters.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Againe, if he turne himſelfe to other Religious perſons, amongſt whome he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, he findeth no comfort at all. For if he perceiue, that the wiſe &amp; ſpirituall brethren make very little reckoning of him, &amp; ſhun his conuerſation and company in what they can, he cannot but be much troubled &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in mind, and therfore is forced to keep company with his like, who be deſirous of a more free and diſordered life. Neither can he yet receiue any ſolide comfort from them, for that where the ſpirit of deuotion is not, there neither peace nor ioy can be of continuance. The friendſhip of the bad is not long laſting, and is euer ſuſpected: and where ſuſpition raigneth, the mind is euer in ſuſpence and doubtfull, and therefore he cannot poſſibly be truly merry.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Finally, if a bad religious man turne his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:15101:52"/>
eyes vpon himſelfe, he hath no cauſe of reioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, but of lamenting. For ſith he hath no part in true vertues at all, he hath none to direct him in his actions, nor who may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and help him in his temptations, and ſo he becometh prone to fall, yea &amp; to apoſtaſie alſo. Againe, what ioy can he haue, who muſt take great paynes without hope of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall profit? As long as he is in religion, he muſt needs exerciſe himſelfe in the ordinary offices of the ſame; which becauſe he doth vnwillingly, or with loathing, murmuring, and other imperfections, he looſeth all his merit. Beſides that, what comfort can he haue, who receyueth a torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in wholſome and meritorious actions? Who wanteth ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and cannot be holpen? if he be to pray, he is in paine; if to heare a ſermon, or ſome pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſpirituall talke, he loatheth it; if diſcourſe about the purchaſing of vertue, he may not endure to heare it. O miſerable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man who drinketh gal, when others taſt of moſt ſweet hony! It is a ſigne of death, when the ſick perſon becometh the weaker by receiuing a medicine.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Moreouer in enduring tribulations, he is ſo much the more afflicted, by how much leſſe he was armed, &amp; prepared againſt them; like vnto a little boate, when a ſore tempeſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:15101:52"/>
ariſeth, wanting both oares &amp; ſterne. By one thing alone he may ſeeme he may be eaſed of all his troubles and miſeries, and take ſome poore refreſhment and quiet, and that is by death. But death, vnles he want the vſe of reaſon, will rather increaſe his feare, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. For the ſooner it ſhall come, the ſooner ſhal he be preſented to my Tribunall, to giue an accompt of euery moment ſpent in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion without ſpirituall profit. For death is to the bad &amp; wicked the beginning of more heauy puniſhments.</p>

                     <p>That a Religious man ought with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to labour to the attayning of Perfection.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <head>CHAP. XIIII.</head>
                  <p>LORD, if I ſhould mount vp to the tree of vertue, to gather of the ſweet fruit of Perfection, I find not where I may ſtay my ſelfe. For the tree is very high, and my forces very weake, my nature is afraid, my body conceyueth an horrour of it, and if it be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed forwards, it kicketh and refuſeth, and therfore I am forced to ſtay vpon the ground beneath, becauſe it is impoſſible for me to get vp higher. But tell me, Son, how I pray thee, can it be ſaid to be impoſſible, when as all religious, as many as be now in heauen,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:15101:53"/>
and many more, who be ſtill liuing on earth, haue not without their exceeding great commendation, mounted vp to it, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered of the wiſhed fruite of perfection. Yet I muſt confeſſe, that ſome came to the height of it more ſpeedily, and ſome more ſlowly, ſome with more merit, &amp; ſome with leſſe. And therfore for euery one that hath a will; it is neither impoſſible to follow them, nor very hard: if thy forces be not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, thou haſt my help at hand: if thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and cooperation be not wanting, my grace ſhall not fayle thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To get vp to the height of this tree, and to gather the fruit of perfection, is to get the victory: and to obtaine the victory, a man muſt needs carry himſelfe manfully. To ſtatuaes and pictures may a ſcepter &amp; crown be giuen, though they neuer come to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, but not to a reaſonable creature, and free, to whome the crowne of vertue is his reward, and the reward is not giuen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out merit, nor merit without encounter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent and gone before. If then thou aſpireſt to the crowne of vertue &amp; the perfection of it, thou muſt needs prepare thy ſelfe to the pains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; to the fight as others haue done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee. He knoweth not what a reward is, who expecteth it without labour &amp; paines.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:15101:53"/>
Seeing then the hope and confidence of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning perfection, relyeth not only on the help of my grace, but on thine owne coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration alſo, thou muſt of neceſſity on thy part performe the conditions, that I am now to ſet downe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Firſt, neceſſary it is, that thou haue a true and ſincere deſire of labouring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: for this deſire is not only the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the aforeſaid confidence, but alſo helpeth to the furthering of thy progreſſe &amp; going forwards, to the ouercoming of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultyes that euer and anon occur vpon the way, and to the mitigating and eaſing of all the paines. Sonne, experience ſufficiently tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that he who hath not a deſire, ſeeketh not, and that he who hath a great deſire of a thing, ſeeketh it earneſtly. Againe putting thy confidence in me, begin thou with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to exerciſe the actions, now of this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, now of that; for by ſo doing thou ſhalt extirpate all thy bad inclinations, and in place of them plant in thy mind all the moſt beautifull ſlyps of vertues. And though I am accuſtomed to lend my helping hand in this buſines; yet know thou, that I other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles try a Religious man by the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of my help, that ſo his conſtancy may appeare, and how great a confidence he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:15101:54"/>
hath in me.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. O how much is a Religious man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, who if he peraduenture ſtumble in the middeſt of his courſe, intended to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of perfection, by falling into ſome imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or finding himſelfe not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ſo much in vertue as he deſireth, fainteth, and is quite diſcouraged: &amp; diffident of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to arriue to perfection, neglecteth to hold on, or to proceed any further: and of this it cometh to paſſe, that after that he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth himſelfe far more free ſcope to runne a diſordered courſe of life, then euer before. This is not the way to get the victory, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it an argument &amp; ſigne of a valiant &amp; noble mind, but of a faint &amp; cowardly hart.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Certes, that way-faring man ſhould be deemed mad who would not hold on the iourney he had begon, or ſhould go backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, becauſe he trypped and ſtumbled once vpon a ſtone, or had had a fall: for that were nothing els then of a ſmall euill to cauſe a greater. But the wiſe &amp; wary trauayler doth not ſo, but if peraduenture he ſlippe, or haue a fall, he preſently riſeth againe, &amp; continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his iourney forwards: and of this fall he learneth to be more wary and heedfull for the time to come, that he fall no more. The very like hapneth amongſt religious men.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:15101:54"/>
For when one vnwary and vnprouident falleth into any imperfection, he neither hath a care or deſire to riſe againe, neither is he vigilant to preuent a fall againſt another time. But when a prudent &amp; ſpirituall man falleth, he ſodainly getteth vp vpon his feet againe, and if he ſhould fall an hundred tims a day, he would riſe vp againe an hundred times, and would be ſorry for his falls. Whence it is, that he is not only not diſmaid but he alſo doth with greater earneſtnes, care and endeauour by the exerciſe of vertues, hold on his way to perfection. And this is of euill to draw out good.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Thoſe Religious men be alſo decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, who thinke the exerciſe of vertues to be laborious, painefull and hard, and therefore for feare of preiudicing and hurting their health of body, they let courage fall, become puſillanimous, or like vnto skittiſh horſes will not go forwards with ſpurring, but do reſiſt, &amp; kicke. Theſe men would (forſooth) runne on to the reward of vertues without any their owne paines taking, and with the enioying of their accuſtomed recreations: but truly the nature of man is not ſo fruitfull a ground, as to yeald forth fruit of it ſelfe without husbanding &amp; manuring: neither is the condition of vertues ſo comtemptible,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:15101:55"/>
as a religious man ought not worthily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his owne commodityes, and the pleaſure of his ſenſes, that he may attayne to the perfection of them. It is ſelfe loue, that thruſteth a man into this deceitfull conceit, that he haue a greater regard of the temporal commodities of his body, then of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ornaments of his mind. Who fauoureth his body ouer much, thruſteth vertue head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long out of his owne ſoule.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There be found other Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who forbeare to profit in the ſtudy of perfection, becauſe they haue a conceit, that I will not affoard them ſo much help and aſſiſtance, as is to be required to this ſtudy: and this opinion is worſe then the former. What is this els, then for them to offend me, and to deceiue themſelues? For not to put their confidence in me, is to do me an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant iniury, as if I knew not how to help them, or could not, or would not. It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo, I deſire nothing more then to help, neither do I euer withdraw my internall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations, or other meanes, for the ſtirring vp of them to perfection, and for this end I haue taken &amp; drawn them out of the world. How then can any be deſtitute of my help? How can he be diffident of my grace, ſith I continually ſtand and knock at the doore,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:15101:55"/>
that I may be let in, and help euery ones ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity? If they will with this cloke couer their cowardize and ſlouthfullnes, they are deceiued, becauſe they lay it much the more open. He that layeth his owne fault vpon others, ſinneth double.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. So it is, Lord, it is not thine, but out fault, that we go not on to perfection. For ſith thou art moſt wiſe, thou knoweſt the ways of helping vs, becauſe thou art omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, thou art able alſo to do it, neither art thou vnwilling, becauſe thy wil is goodnes it ſelfe, and therfore all the fault is entirely and abſolutely ours.</p>

                  <p>SONNE, a faint harted and fearefull ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier will neuer ſet his flagge vpon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies walls, for that ouer much feare cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him either to keep himſelfe aloof off, or if he be neere, to turne his backe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deſerueth not any reward, neither is held in any eſteeme with his Generall; and more then that, is contemned for a coward, &amp; one without hart, of his fellow ſouldiers.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:15101:56"/>
I would not haue my ſeruant ouer bold or temerarious, and raſh, nor yet ouer fearefull. I deſire he ſhould be magnanimous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and not be afraid where no cauſe of feare is.

Truly if Religious perſons were as ready to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and lay hold on the help, that I offer them, and by their owne induſtry to coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate with my grace, as there is deſire in me to affoard it, there would be a far greater number of perfect perſons, then now there be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither is the power of the enemy ſo great, as it may hinder, or draw a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man from the way of perfection. For though the enemy be powerfull, yet if the Religious man haue a will, he may not only be not ouercome or hindred by him, but it is in his power alſo eaſily to ouercome him, ſith his power and might conſiſteth only in tempting, and not in ouercoming and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, vnles a man would willingly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

be hindred or ouercome by him. The enemy is weak inough, who hath no power giuen him of ouercoming, but of ſuch as be willing to be ouercome, and therfore it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a baſe mind in a man, who ſuffereth ſuch a one to preuaile againſt him. And he who tempted by the enemy, falling not, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a great gayne in ſpirit, for that by ſuch exerciſe he becometh the more couragious, ſtoute, and the more conſtant; and truſting to the help of greater ſtrength, he proceedeth on to perfection, which is nothing, but to gayne perfection it ſelfe. For the more often a ſouldier hath tryed his manhood in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his weapons, and in the more warres he hath ſerued, the better ſouldier is he reputed, and the more experimented.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Neither muſt a good Religious man, for the mockings, &amp; taunts of the imperfect or negligent, ceaſe to hold on, &amp; continue in the way to perfection: for that were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard more the ſpeaches of the bad, then my inſpirations, that are intended for his ſoules good. O how much do they diſpleaſe and offend me, who with their peſtilent tongues do bite, and detract thoſe Religious perſons who take exceeding great paines about the attayning of perfection, and ſay, that they make ouer much haſt to the height of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity,

or ayme at ouer high matters that they may haue the greater fall after. And there want not thoſe, who be not afraid to ſay, that for a man to giue himſelfe to deuotion, is nothing els, then to hurt his health, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his head with melancholy, and to make himſelfe quite vnable for the ſeruing of God. Meruaile it is, that ſuch men do not conſider and ſee, how much hurt they do by theſe their poyſoned ſpeaches, though the ſame may ſeeme to be vttered in ieſt. And whiles they do not well themſelues, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer others to do well, they do ſeeme to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the office of the Diuell.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:15101:57"/>
to the loue of God, &amp; animated one another to the mortification of their paſſions, and to the contempt of themſelues, that ſo they might come to that perfection, which they propoſed vnto themſelues, and ſought for.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But ſuppoſe, that a religious man, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter counſaile, by the iudgment of his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, or of his ghoſtly Father, giuen about exerciſing vertue with diſcretion, become ſicke therby, how great an hurt is this?

Do theſe men thinke, that if a pious and good religious man fall ſicke, I am forthwith diſpleaſed with him? None do diſpleaſe me but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, who the more healthfull they be in body, the more grieuouſly do they oftentims offend me. A ſicke Religious man, ſo be be deuout, is more gratefull to me, then one in health if he want deuotion, for as much as he giueth good example in ſicknes, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth vertue, neither wherof is to be found in the whole vndeuout perſon: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a religious man deſirous of perfection, when he is ſicke, before me ſuſtayneth no loſſe of any thing, becauſe I pay my ſouldiers their ordinary wages alike, both in time of

ſicknes and of health.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A ſpirituall diſeaſe, growing of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, bringeth great hurt, &amp; not that ſicknes of the body, of which good religious perſons oftentimes make a ſingular profit to themſelues.

Auoid theſe ill meaning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractours, as thou wouldſt do venemous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents: and know thou, that if thou contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne what they maliciouſly calumniate, and attend to the loue of perfection, thou ſhalt increaſe thine owne glory; becauſe I, for loue of whome thou doeſt this, will in moſt liberall manner reward thee.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Some againe will not follow the way of perfection, becauſe they ſee but few to walke therein: but this is no iuſt cauſe, that a buſynes ſo fruitfull, and laudable, ſhould be omitted. What ſkilleth it, whether thou haſt many or few companions in ſo moſt

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and merit, then diminiſh it: yea thou oughteſt to reckon it for a ſingular benefit in that it hath hapned to few. There be alſo few elected, though many be called: and many runne in the race, &amp; but one wynneth the prize. If thou canſt be one of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe few, &amp; merit a precious crowne, why forbeareſt thou to runne?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He that laboureth out of loue, is not ſollicitous about the company of others, but it is inough, that he be not wanting vnto him, for whoſe ſake he taketh the paynes. I am he, for whoſe ſake all religious perſons runne the race of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I am their guide captaine, and companion. I help, eaſe, and defend them, &amp; this alone ſhould be inough for them, to continue their iourney with a ſtout, able, and willing mind. Neither muſt thou meruaile, that this way is traced of few, becauſe they be few, who mortifie themſelus in earneſt, who reſtraine their deſires, and contemne the flattery of the ſenſes, &amp; many there be, who ſuffer themſelues by delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full allurements of this world to be carryed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:15101:59"/>
away into the ſpatious &amp; broad way, which no man, but knoweth how repugnant it is to a Religious eſtate.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Moreouer there be ſome, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt themſelues to be with-held from the commendation of this perfection for human reſpects, and tho commodities of fortune, which is nothing els then to be notably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious to vertue, whoſe property is to be an ornament to a religious man: whereas contrariwiſe human reſpects, and all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall commodities are to be troden vnder his feet, and contemned. He then who leaueth thoſe for theſe, doth neceſſarily put vertue vnder a religious mans feet, and raiſeth hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reſpect vpon his head.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Againe he that more regardeth the worlds eſtimation, and riches therof then perfection, whereunto I daily exhort all religious perſons, doth me an iniury, and himſelfe hurt. For all know, that he who ſhall be aſhamed of me before men, I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be aſhamed of him before the Angells of God. But what abſurdity, and folly is this? They, when they liued in the world, out of a deſire of following perfection, did forſake the world, the temporall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities therof, and all humane things beſids: but now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing imbraced religion, they will giue ouer
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:15101:59"/>
perfection, to follow the world. Is not this a manifeſt folly? And ſith humane reſpect is nothing els then a certaine vaine feare, leaſt a man be diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended in ſome one or other of his actions; how is it poſſible, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man, deſirous of perfection can be diſcommended? Can there any greater glory befall him in this life, then if this may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed &amp; ſaid of him? And what new thing can happen to a religious man, if he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned of the world? Doth he expect any reward or recompence from it? Or is he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, leaſt it would cenſure him by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation? It maketh no matter, whether a religious man be loued or hated of the world; but it auayleth much, if he be deare to me.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. To conclude, others forbeare to tread this way of perfection, by reaſon of the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnance that mans nature findeth in practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the meanes, and for the difficulties that the body maketh trial of, in tracing the ſame way. But theſe men miſſe the marke: for to be a true Religious man, or to walke on to perfection, is nothing els but to mortifie the deſires of the fleſh, and the perturbations of the mind. And therfore, if thou forbeare the exerciſe of vertue, leaſt thou incommodate or hurt thy body, thou loueſt thy ſelfe too

ſenſually: neither do I ſee, what difference there is betweene thee, and a delicate ſecular perſon. Remember Sonne, that theſe be not the promiſes thou madeſt at thy entrance to religion; for then thou didſt purpoſe with thy ſelfe to ſuffer many things for me, to chaſtiſe thy body, to ſerue me, and for loue of religious perfection to depriue and ſpoyle thy ſelfe of all humane conſolation.</p>

For ſo I declared vnto my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when I exhorted them to be perfect, not as the Patriarcks, and Prophets were, nor as the Seraphims, and other the Angells, but as my Father in heauen. O how doth that Religious perſon pleaſe me, who like the couetous man is deſirous of true vertue, and perfection. The couetous man hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his fil: for the more he hath, the more he deſireth. And I would haue religious men

ſuch followers of ſpirituall couetouſnes. For it is a ſigne of a baſe mind, if a man, when he hath meanes to attaine to greater perfection, do propoſe vnto himſelfe, and thinke vpon leſſer. But I deſire to haue my ſeruants valiant, and generouſly minded, who aſpire to great and hard matters. For if I haue created them to an end, the moſt excellent in the world, &amp; haue raiſed them vp to ſo high a ſtate, that is, to be Religious; why ſhould they not with all their poſſible forces labour to perfection, that would be moſt contenting to vs both?

                  <p n="3">3. Who would deny, that it is a fowle and ſhamefull thing for a Religious man, to ſtay in the loweſt degree of vertue, when he ſeeth ſecular men neuer to make a ſtay in their degree of ſtate of life, which they haue once imbraced, but euer to aſpire to an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher, vntill they come to the higheſt? Hence it is, that a vulgar perſon firſt ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to raiſe himſelfe to be a Gentleman, then a Baron, next an Earle, a Marques, a Duke, vntill in concluſion he lay hold on the Scepter and Crowne: and when he is come to this, he is not contented with an ordinary Crowne, but he ſeeketh a more rich, more potent, &amp; a more noble Crown, and conſequently the greateſt that can be had in this life. And ſhall a Religious man be of ſo daſtardly a mind, as not to labour to obtaine a moſt noble ſpirituall Crowne? Should he ſtand in the firſt degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, when he may with his great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, and no leſſe profit mount vp to the higheſt? Is not this a ſtrang kind of ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhnes, and folly? Is not this to make a light eſteeme of my will, and to refuſe the help of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15101:64"/>
my grace, by the benefit wherof he might compaſſe an higher degree of perfection?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Vnderſtand my Sonne, that a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man is more deare vnto me, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoureth for my greater glory, to arriue to the higheſt degree of perfection: and this ought not without cauſe to be inough vnto him, not to ſtay in his courſe, but ſtil to hold on. Go to tel me, what ſeruant is ſo conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible &amp; vile, who is contented to be in litle grace and fauour with his Lord, when he may be in very great? Why then, thou Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man, who art for ſo many reſpects bound vnto me, as my ſeruant, why I ſay, when by labouring to perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou mayſt deſerue my extraordinary fauour, thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layeſt to do it?

                     </gap> thou therfore, who mayſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpilling of thy blood, or loſſe of life, increaſe thy glory and crowne in heauen from day to day by profiting towards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſtand ſtill in the dore, contented with a very ſmall meaſure of perfection?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Take heed, my Sonne, leaſt that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall vnto thee, which I told my diſciple of: <hi>That to him who hath, shall be giuen; and from him who hath not, shall alſo be taken away that he hath.</hi> Neither is that wont to be done only for a puniſhment of ingratitude, but ordinarily alſo it hapneth to all things more or leſſe affected with ſome quality. For example: Wood not much kindled, eaſily forgoeth the little hear that it hath, not ſo if it had been well kindled. So a Religious man, who hath gotten but little perfection, doth very eaſily looſe it; but he, who hath got many degrees of it, doth not eaſily forſake it, but is like a tree that hath taken deep roote, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:15101:65"/>
ſtrongly reſiſteth both winds, and tempeſts.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There be alſo ſome, who affected to a more free life, do for purging of themſelus ſay, that the ſtudy of perfection is only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Nouices. But they be miſerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued; for as much as all religious perſons be bound to labour to perfection, and the more ancient a man is in religion, the more diligent ſhould he be in furniſhing himſelfe with vertues, as he, who ought to haue both a greater vnderſtanding and knowledge of his owne obligation, and hath a longer tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and experience of the ſweetnes of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. He that is not hungry, is ſoone filled: and it is an ill ſigne in a religious man, if he receiue no pleaſure in the ſtudy of vertues.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Others contrariwiſe haue an ouer haſty deſire to get vp to the higheſt degree of perfection, and if they happen peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to fall into ſome defect, they be eftſoons diſcouraged, and looſe their courage. But this is not my will, neither is it the way of labouring to perfection. For the greateſt perfection is in the victory &amp; ouercoming of all vices, and in the purchaſing of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, &amp; for the effecting of this, there muſt be ſome continuance of tyme. Wherfore to ſeeke eueryday more perfection then other (which we ſpeake of heere) is nothing els
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:15101:66"/>
but to ouercome the paſſions, or to reſtraine the perturbations of the mind, &amp; the inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate deſires therof. And to be abſolutly perfect, is nothing els, then after the victory ouer our ſelues to be dead to the world, and to liue to god alone.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. He that hath enemies and aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, can neuer be ſecure, vnles he cut them off cleane, and deſtroy them: but neceſſary it is not, that he take them a way at one time, &amp; all togeather. So a Religious mans enemyes be the paſſions, which dayly rebell againſt him, and though he cannot ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all at once at one &amp; the ſame time; yet let him labour to extirpate one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo doing, he ſhall hold on to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfection. In like manner an whole Kingdome is not ſet vpon all at once, but now one caſtle is taken from the enemy, and then another, or ſome Citty brought in ſubiection, and ſo one after another, vntill he be come poſſeſſed of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: Euen ſo doth a religious man, who hath a deſire to inuade &amp; ſet vpon the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of perfection, whiles he muſt now gaine one vertue, and then another: &amp; this is euery day to labour to greater perfection.

                  <p>SONNE, little profiteth the good health of body to be recouered, if it be after hurt againe by any intemperance of eating, or other careleſnes, ſince the relapſe into ſicknes is more dangerous, then the ſicknes it ſelfe. The ſame is the conſideration of ſpirituall Perfection, which once being had, profiteth little, if we forgo it againe, through default of our owne vigilancy and wary keeping of the ſame. And if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe into corporall ſicknes be a matter of ſo great conſideration for the daunger tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards the body; much more is to be feared a relapſe into the old imperfections, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the ſpirituall life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sonne, deſireſt thou to be freed from the daunger of dying ſpiritually? Then ſhunne thoſe things, that be diſpoſitions to that death. For we learne by dayly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that they, who once languiſh in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:15101:67"/>
ſtudy of perfection, do fall into a thouſand defects, and into ſo great leuity and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of manners, liberty of conuerſation, and imprudency of mind, as not only all ſhame laid aſide, they do nothing worthy of prayſe, but do furthermore glory, &amp; reioyce in their owne errours and defects. And in this they be not vnlike to thoſe Angells, who fell from heauen, and togeather with their moſt greiuous ruine, loſt alſo all their ſpirituall gifts, and procured to themſelues moſt extreme euills. For looke how much more excellent they were in dignity then all creatures, ſo much more by their fall from heauen they became worſe, and more contemptible then them all. My Apoſtle alſo, who betrayed me, from his dignity of Apoſtleſhip fell into the downfall of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The ſame hapneth to the Religious men, who from the higher degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection they fal, be the more ſorely bruized and cruſhed by their fal, and become worſe. And as he is called happy, who declineth from euill, and imbraceth good: ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe miſerable and vnhappy is that man, who forſaking the way of perfection, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth &amp; holdeth on the way of licenciouſnes and liberty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But to conſerue the degree of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:15101:67"/>
thou haſt gotten, there be two vertues that may help thee, and thoſe be <hi>Loue,</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi> Loue will make thee vigilant to auoid the daungers growing from theeues, and robbers. Humility will conceale and hide thee, that thou come not within their view or ſight. And how profitable &amp; auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Loue is for this purpoſe, it is no hard matter to demonſtrate. A rich and wealthy man, who is not in loue with his riches, ſoone looſeth them. For he that loueth not any thing, eſteemeth it not: and he that eſteemeth it not, hath no care of keeping it: and euery one knoweth, that a thing negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly kept, is eaſily loſt. Euen ſo as neceſſary it is for a Religious man to be greatly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the perfection he hath once got: for of loue there is cauſed a feare of looſing it: of feare a ſollicitude &amp; diligence in keeping it: &amp; ſolicitude againe cauſeth him to find, and ſearch out meanes and wayes, neceſſary &amp; profitable for attayning to the end.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whoſoeuer hath a care to keep his corporall health, asketh aduiſe of expert &amp; learned Phiſitians, eateth good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meats, keepeth his ſet times of eating, neglecteth not requiſite exerciſes of body, chooſeth an habitation in a healthfull place, and ayre approued of the Phiſitians,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:15101:68"/>
keepeth himſelfe out of the rayne, winds, and from other outward incommodities; and in few words, is very carefull not to exceed in any thing, that may peraduenture any way hurt him. The ſame cauſeth ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude in a Religious man, if he haue a deſire to conſerue Perfection, and ſeeke his ſoules health. For firſt his care is not to order his owne life according to his owne will, or by the counſaile of more looſe and free compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but rather by the direction of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and ſpirituall Fathers. Secondly, to eate of good meats, namely thoſe that I vſed my ſelfe, when I liued on earth, that is, to do the will of my Father, who is in heauen, whoſe will is our ſoules ſanctification. And therfore whatſoeuer God giueth vs for the ſanctifying of the ſoule, is the beſt meat, as contrariwiſe whatſoeuer maketh to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing therof, ſuch as be ſinnes, is the worſt poyſon of all. Thirdly, he neglecteth not the vſe and exerciſe of vertues. For ſith per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is founded in Charity, which is like vnto fire, whereunto if wood be caſt, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, if it be remoued and taken away, it goeth out: Euen ſo, the more, Religious men, who haue their part in Charity, do exerciſe themſelues in vertue, the more they profit in perfection: and the leſſe they be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:15101:68"/>
exerciſed in them, the leſſe they get of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: And therfore all exerciſe of vertue ceaſing, perfection ceaſeth alſo.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And as touching an healthful place, where the ſoule is to dwell, I know none comparable to Religion, where I haue pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the religious man: but if we conſider particular places, the beſt is that, that his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Phiſitians or Fathers aſſigne him. And if he would fly all occaſions of falling into any imperfections, he ſhal ſo very well arme and defend himſelfe againſt all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward difficulties. Finally he committeth no exceſſe, becauſe in all doubtfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he repaireth to his ſpirituall Father, &amp; ſeaſoneth all pennances and mortifications with the ſalt of moderation and diſcretion.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The other way that conſerueth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, is by humility. He that is become poſſeſſed of a rich and pretious iewell, is very wary three ways, that he looſe it not at any tyme. Firſt he layeth it vp in a ſecret place, that it may not eaſily be ſeene, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, or found of others. Secondly, he letteth not euery owne ſee it, neither doth he openly brag, that he hath ſuch a Iewell. Thirdly, he taketh it not from the thing, whereat it hangeth. For example, the heat of water dependeth of the fire, and if you
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:15101:69"/>
remoue it from the fire, it looſeth the heate. Humility in a Religious man, whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtone is the ſtudy of perfection, reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyeth all theſe three daungers.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>ON, when any thing, though otherwiſe of great worth is not knowne, it is not much eſteemed, becauſe the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy &amp; worth therof is obſcured by the darknes of ignorance, and therby the due eſtimation is taken away. And this is the cauſe, wherefore the three Vowes, that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:15101:70"/>
be made in Religion, be not ſo eſteemed of ſome, euen Religious men themſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they vnderſtand not the worth, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, &amp; profit therof. He cannot be free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fault, who vnderſtandeth not what in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his ſtate he both may, and ought to know. Wherfore know thou (my Son) that the excellency of theſe vows is greater then many conceiue, neither are they of litle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. And vnder the name of <hi>Vow,</hi> is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood an obligation of a Religious man made to God his Creatour, of performing and doing ſome better good. And ſith this obligation is very noble, ſpirituall, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, euery religious man ought not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, diligently to ponder, reuerently to eſteeme, and exactly to obſerue the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it is moſt noble, it cleerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by this; for that the will bindeth it ſelfe, which amongſt the faculties of the ſoule holdeth the principality, &amp; firſt place, and hath a commaund ouer all the reſt of the powers. Againe, it is moſt noble, becauſe it is made to God, whoſe maieſty is infinite, &amp; who is the authour of all true excellency. Moreouer becauſe it is made for a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble end, namely the glory of Gods Name, which is the more amplified, the more exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly that obligation is kept. There is added
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:15101:70"/>
further, that the vertue of Religion among all morall vertues excelleth for noblenes &amp; dignity. Seeing therfore a Vow is an action of that moſt noble vertue that giueth light to all other vertues, it manifeſtly followeth, that a Vow is a moſt noble vertue. For what the tree is, the ſame be the fruits therof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And that this obligation is ſpiritual and holy, is out of controuerſy; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is directed to a ſpirituall good, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely to holines of life, and becauſe it is the very entrance and beginning of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life of Religious men. Whereupon as the life of the body dependeth on the hart as the beginning: ſo the religious life, and to be a religious man hath the dependance of this holy obligation. And as by the leaſt hurt of the hart, the life of body receiueth great hurt alſo, and the hart being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the life is taken away togeather: euen ſo by the very leaſt default in the obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this obligation, the Religious life is much preiudiced, and that againe ceaſing, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, a man ceaſeth to be Religious. The nearer the euill cometh to the hart, the more dangerous it is.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That this obligation is diuine, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo certaine, becauſe it is of the holy Ghoſt, who by his diuine inſpiration moueth a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:15101:71"/>
mans mind to the making of ſuch an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Secondly, becauſe the perſon, to whome it is made, is diuine, that is, God himſelfe. Now let a Religious man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and ſee, how much he ought to loue it, with what regard to keep it, and with what deuotion, and care to obſerue it in all things that he is able, becauſe it is made to him, who penetrateth and entreth into the moſt inward ſecret of the hart, and well knoweth, who hath iuſt cauſe to obſerue it, and who not.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But now I would deſire to know of thoſe to whome it cauſeth ſome trouble and difficulty, that they be tyed in ſo noble and holy a band, what the cauſe is, that ſecular men haue them in ſo great regard, and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? They will ſay perhaps, becauſe they be religious and my ſeruants. And what made them religious and my ſeruants, but theſe three Vowes? Many ſecular perſons liue at this day in the world, far more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, more holy, and more perfect then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Religious, and yet be they nothing ſo much honored, as religious men be; and the cauſe is, becauſe they be not tyed to me by theſe holy bands of Vowes. Secular men, when they behold Religious perſons, doe conſider them, as wholy mine, by three
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:15101:71"/>
Vowes conſecrated to me, &amp; what honour they do them, they thinke they giue to me. But this they do not to men of the world, though otherwiſe eminent for their vertue: and therfore to be tyed in theſe bands, is no contemptible matter, but moſt honorable, and moſt noble, euen to the world, ſith the Religious be in ſo great veneration with the great men of the world.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Theſe three Vowes againe be of very great regard, for that they cauſe the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to triumph victoriouſly, and to go away with victory ouer their three deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For whils they exerciſe <hi>Pouerty</hi> againſt the vanity of the world, <hi>Chaſtity</hi> againſt the tentation of the fleſh, and <hi>Obedience</hi> againſt the frauds of the crafty diuell, they go eaſily away with victory. But thoſe Religious, who vſe not theſe kind of armes, are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhamefully ouercome. Let not him be a ſouldier, who will not take a weapon in hand, neither let him go to the battaile, who refuſeth to fight.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And now tell me, my Sonne, what thoſe Religious men deſerue, who make but light eſteeme of ſo holy, and godly an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and what they alſo deſerue, who keep it not, when they may, &amp; ought to keep it? What puniſhment attendeth them, who
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:15101:72"/>
do not only breake it, but further contemne it alſo? O how ſtraite an accompt are they to make, not only of their owne tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but alſo of thoſe of others, that is, of thoſe, who by their bad example were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to violate and breake their Vowes they had before made vnto me. For pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by Vowe is not made to men, but to the diuine maieſty: it is not made vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, but voluntarily. Neither is the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation therof concerning any light or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall matter, but touching a great and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall matter, that is, the ſaluation of the Soule. He that lightly regardeth what he hath once promiſed to God, ſhall againe be as little regarded of God.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                  <p>LORD, our Nature is ſo ſore depreſſed &amp; ſurcharged with the weight of our owne miſeries, as I know not, whether it were good and profitable for a man to bind himſelfe by Vowes, ſith to me it ſeemeth nothing els, but to adde one burden to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conſequently much to be feared, leaſt in concluſion, ſeeing it is very weake,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:15101:72"/>
it fall vnder the burden. And more then this there be ſo many obligations, and bands of precepts impoſed partly by thee, partly by thy Church layd vpon vs, as it is almoſt impoſſible for vs to ſatisfy them; therefore it ſeemeth not good to ſurcharge our ſelues with new bands of Vowes. Neither doth there appeare ſo great vtility likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound vnto vs by the benefit of Vowes, but that there is preſented a greater daunger by tranſgreſſing, and breaking them. I add fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lord, that fre and voluntary offices of deuotion are more accepted off by thee, then be the forced. But whoſoeuer ſhall make a Vow, is forced to ſtand to his promiſe, and therfore I ſee not, how great a vtility there is of Vowes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou art deceiued, my Sonne. For Vowes be burdens that load not, but rather eaſe, &amp; help nature it ſelfe to the exerciſing of all more noble works. The feathers and wings of byrdes carry a ſhevv of a burden, and yet they help to raiſe them aloft, and without which they cannot fly. Beſids, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth, that they be religious, who do moſt promptly &amp; moſt exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the commaundments of God: whence it appeareth, that by the benefit of Vowes they are holpen to obſerue the precepts of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:15101:73"/>
God, and of the Church, after a more exact, and perfect manner.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thou art wide, if thou thinkeſt that any profit returneth to me by thy Vowes. It is not ſo. There is no ſowing, nor mowing for me heere. Promiſes made to men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the profit of them to whome they be made, but the merit of the Vowes that are made to me, remaineth to the vtility of him who voweth: yea the honour &amp; glory that of Vowes ariſe to me and my ſeruice, appertaineth alſo to the good of them that vow. For I do abundantly reward them, as I do ſeuerely chaſtiſe the bad workes, that be diſhonorable to piety, and to the ſeruice of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And where thou ſayſt, that by Vows all liberty is taken away, in ſo much as the Religious do all things of neceſſity, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue no merit of their works at all, thou art deceiued. For there be two neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; one naturall, and this taketh away all liberty, merit, &amp; commendation of all good works, ſuch as is the falling of a ſtone down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. The other is voluntary, or procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the will, or of a promiſe voluntarily made, and this doth not only not take away the merit of the good worke, but alſo much increaſeth it: for that both the worke, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:15101:73"/>
the promiſe be voluntary and free. And this is the neceſſity ſo highly commended of the bleſſed in heauen, becauſe it did driue them to the exerciſing of the more noble, and more excellent workes. Happy is that neceſſity, which compelleth to what is better.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Moreouer thou muſt know, my Son, that the grief, &amp; difficulty, which we other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles find and feele in executing our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Vowes, doth not take away nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh in the Religious their merit, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſe it: for in fullfilling our Vows, there is not only done a good worke, but that heauines, repugnance, and difficulty is further ouercome, which indeed is a matter of no little conſequence. Howbeit to full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill a good worke promiſed by Vow, though there occurre no difficulty in doing it, is more meritorious, then to fulfill it without any precedent Vow. For as I will declare after, the Vow it ſelfe is meritorious, which merit he hath not who doth a good worke, which he before promiſed to do without making a Vow.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There be other vtilityes, which vowes do bring to the Religious. For firſt vndoubted it is, that the tree, the deceper roote it ſhall take within the earth, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:15101:74"/>
forth the better fruite: Euen ſo mans will, the more ſtable it ſhal be in good, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the more noble works. And among the effects of Vowes one is, that it maketh the will more firme in good works. Who knoweth not, how various, and mutable mans will is: now it is willing, &amp; within a while it is vnwilling, and what pleaſeth to day, diſpleaſeth to morrow. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les it would be better, if the will were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and ſtable in imbracing good, and that it may be ſtable and immutable, is effected by the benefit of Vowes. For ſo ſoone as a man ſhall h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ue made a Vow, he muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, neither may he reuoke it without ſinne: &amp; that he may not go backe, is both profitable and good, and deriued from the very nature of a Vow. And of this it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that a good worke proceeding from a will grounded in good, is better then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good workes, and deſerueth a more ample reward. As contrariwiſe a bad and hurtfull worke, comming from a peruerſe and obdurate will, is more deteſtable then other ill works, and meriteth a more ſore puniſhment. Would you haue a Lunatike perſon to do no hurt? Then bind him faſt vpon the firſt occaſion.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Another vtility nothing inferiour
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:15101:74"/>
to the former, is this. Euery man will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that it moſt profiteth a man, if he be moſt inwardly vnited to God Almighty. And this is effected by Vowes: for whiles a man by Vowes bindeth himſelfe to me, I am in like maner tyed againe faſt vnto him; and therfore if the Religious do by theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred bands bind themſelues faſt vnto me, &amp; ſo become mine, how is it poſſible, that I ſhould not deliuer my ſelfe vnto them alſo? That I ſhould not help them, not defend them, not conſerue, &amp; keep them, as a thing moſt deare vnto me? I ſhould not be what I am, if my creature ſhould go beyond me in liberality. Wherfore it is very agreable to reaſon, that ſeeing they haue moſt firmely conioyned themſelues to me the fountaine of Grace, I ſhould alſo communicate vnto them the flowing ſtreames of my grace, and my heauenly gifts, and take ſo great care of them, as neither the Diuell, nor any other creature may do them harme. The Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious liue ſo much the more ſecure, the more potent, and powerfull is their Lord, and Maiſter to whome they haue conioyned themſelues.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. There is yet another vtility, that al good workes done by Vow, do merit more with God, then thoſe that are not done by
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:15101:75"/>
Vow. He that keepeth chaſtity for loue of me, doth well, and meriteth: but he that for loue of me maketh a Vow of chaſtity &amp; keepeth it, doth better and meriteth more. For the former exerciſeth but one vertue, that is, Continency: but the later exerciſeth two, namely Continency and Religion, the nobleſt of all morall vertues. Moreouer to promiſe a good worke, is a good thing: and to performe a promiſe is alſo good, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for them both a man is held worthy of commendations and thanks. Let him then be more deare vnto thee, who beſtoweth more ſpirituall good vpon thee.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Seing ſo many benefits redound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by Vowes, as the ſtability of the will, the coniunction with God, and the merit of workes, I would be now glad to vnderſtand why ſome, when they ſhould moſt of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice, be ſory that they haue tyed themſelues by Vowes? What cauſe of grief ſhould they haue? For if theſe ſacred bands ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue them of ſome great commodity, they might haue iuſt cauſe of ſorrowing. But indeed they looſe none by it. For as a vine faſtned to a tree, or to a poſt, and therefore leſſe obnoxious and expoſed to the iniury of the winds, bringeth forth better and more abundant fruite, then if it were looſe
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:15101:75"/>
and vntyed: Euen ſo be Religious perſons, by the benefit of theſe Vowes, are more ſtrong, and ſtable, and more free from ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and do yeld greater increaſe of good works, &amp; therefore why ſhould they afflict themſelues with grief?</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Euill muſt needs pleaſe him, who is ſorry for good, or complaineth therof. When good meate is hurtfull to a man, it is a ſigne that his ſtomake is infected and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with bad humours, and therfore it is to be purged with ſome antitode, if he meane to preuent the hazard of his life. In like manner if the making of Vowes, which is good and holy, be to ſome Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon troubleſome, it is a ſigne, that his mind is infected with ſome bad diſpoſition, which muſt be taken away and remoued by the ſpirituall Phiſitian, that the hazard of his ſpirituall death may be auoyded.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <head>CHAP. III.</head>
                  <p>SONNE, how ſhould not the Vowes of the Religious be accepted by me, when as they be made for my honour and glory? How is it, that they ſhould not be deare to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:15101:76"/>
me, when as they be the meanes of attaining perfection, which I do ſo earneſtly deſire at their hands? O how much ſhould ſome earthly Lord glory, if his ſeruants ſhould make him any ſuch promiſe, he would no doubt exult for ioy, though he ſhould not be aſſured, whether they had done it in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, &amp; from their hart, for the loue of him their Lord, or in regard of their owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity. And ſhould not I, who am aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the Religious do from their hart make theſe Vowes, and only for loue of me bind themſelues to the performing of good and holy workes, reioyce, and be glad? Should not I make a demonſtration, how much they pleaſe me?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For there be three things, that do in particular pleaſe me in Vowes. Firſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, wherewith the Vowes be made. Secondly the diligence, wherewith they are obſerued. Thirdly the ioy, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious conceiue by occaſion of the making of their Vowes. Deuotion groweth of the conſideration of the excellency of the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is made in the Vowes. For the Religious man by a benefit of his three Vowes offereth himſelfe wholy in ſacrifice, without reſeruation of any part to himſelfe. And if the ſacrifices of the old law, which
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:15101:76"/>
were of bulles and calues, were ſo pleaſing vnto me; how much ſhall theſe content me, which Religious men do voluntarily offer vnto me? And if I made ſo high eſteeme of Abrahams only will, when he was ready to ſacrifice his only Sonne vnto me, what a reckoning ſhould I make of the ſacrifice, that a Religious man maketh of himſelfe, by offering me his will, ſoule, body and all? Againe, Diligence ariſeth of the loue they carry towards me. He that loueth, cannot expect, or of ſlouth put of till another time, or prolonge that which he knoweth to be very pleaſing to the beloued. And in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious life nothing pleaſeth me more, then the obſeruation of Vowes. Finally ioy for the Vowes made, groweth of this, that the Religious man conſidereth, how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this his oblation was vnto me. O how ſorely ſhould a Religious man offend me, if he ſhould be troubled, and grieued for a thing very well done, and moſt acceptable to me. It is no leſſe a ſinne to be ſorry for a good work, then to be glad of a bad one.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There be alſo other things, that make this Religious oblation moſt pleaſing to me, and cauſe me to make an high eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation therof, and that is, becauſe it hath the beginning of ſincere loue towards me.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:15101:77"/>
For firſt the Religious do by theſe three Vowes, as with three nayles, voluntarily nayle themſelues to the Croſſe for loue of me, not for three dayes alone, but for al their life. They do not only crucify their body with the nayle of Pouerty, and the ſenſes with the naile of Chaſtity, but their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alſo, and their owne iudgment with the naile of Obedience, by obeying their Superiours will rather, then their owne. The theefe that confeſſed me on the Croſſe whereon he did hang a very ſhort time, where he ſpake vnto his companion but one word in fauour of me, taſted ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly of my beſt loue towards him, as I made him that very day an inheritour of paradiſe. And why ſhould I not loue a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man hartily, who in regard of his Vowes made for loue of me, is bound to continue vpon the Croſſe all his life long? Why ſhould not his oblation be moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to me, who for the amplificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my glory expoſeth himſelfe to all dangers, that he may preach my Ghoſpell, not by word alone, but, which is more, by example of life alſo?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another cauſe, why I hold the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Religious perſon amongſt the things that be moſt deare vnto me, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:15101:77"/>
by theſe three Vows he doth witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and willingly giue me whatſoeuer he can giue. For whereas he doth by Vow yeald himſelfe wholy to my ſeruice, he giueth me not only the workes, but alſo the worker of them. Certes, a ſecular man neuer giueth me ſo much: for by doing well, he giueth me nothing but the fruite, and not the tree, whiles a Religious perſon giueth me the one and the other. This further pleaſeth me that the Religious in making their Vowes, make proteſtation, that they will not loue any other beſides me, nor ſerue any but me, and this not for a certaine time, but for all eternity. Moreouer the Religious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate vnto me all their owne right &amp; power of doing anything contrary to their Vow once made, and this pleaſeth me very much. A ſecular perſon, for example, who doth without making any Vow for loue of me renounce all his riches, doth indeed well, yet he reſerueth to himſelfe an intereſt and right of gathering riches togeather againe when he ſhall pleaſe: But a Religious man by making the Vow of Pouerty, depriueth himſelf not only of riches, but alſo of power of heaping or gathering of riches for the time to come, and of all propriety thereunto foreuer.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:15101:78"/>5. The third thing that in the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Vowes pleaſeth me, is, that the Religious do by it not only giue all, but do it after the beſt and moſt perfect manner, that is, that I ſhould haue ſuch a comaund, power, and right ouer them, as I may vſe their ſeruice in whatſoeuer thing, where, when, and as much as ſhall pleaſe me. And hence it is, that the Religious ought not to vſe himſelfe, as a thing of his owne, but as mine, and conſecrated to me. Neither muſt he vſe his owne iudgment, where &amp; when he liſteth, but at my pleaſure, becauſe I am his Lord, and not himſelfe. Wherefore know thou my Religious child, that he ſhal commit a grieuous ſacriledge, who would either take from me that which had beene formerly conſecrated &amp; deliuered vnto me by Vowes, or vſurpe and vſe it at his owne pleaſure. The leſſe thou haſt, and the leſſe thou doſt after thine owne will, the leſſe will thy errour be, and the leſſe accompt thou ſhalt yield to God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The fourth and laſt cauſe is, why I moſt of all approue and allow of the Vows of Religious perſons, is, for whereas the world which is a decevuer of ſoules, is hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to me, I am very glad, if the iuglings, frauds, and vanityes of it be diſcouered and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:15101:78"/>
laid open. And ſeing the Vowes of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious be cleane oppoſite to the world (for by vertue of them all the riches, pleaſures, honors, &amp; other the worlds vanities be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned) they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but be moſt acceptable. But conſider, my Child, that this contempt of the world is not to be manifeſted by an externall ſhew, or by words alone, but by facts and workes, and therefore it is not inough to haue made Vowes, but thou muſt further of neceſſity obſerue, and keep them. It is good to proclayme a defiance to thine enemy, but better it is to ouercome him. While, a Religious perſon performeth his Vowes, he declareth himſelfe an enemy to the world, but when he diſchargeth his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made by Vow, he ouercommeth and vanquiſheth it quite.</p>

                     <p>How conuenient it is, that Religious men bind themſelues to God by three Vowes.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <head>CHAP. IIII.</head>
                  <p>SONNE, it is very agreable, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious be furniſhed and prouided of the armes of three Vertues, which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by Vowes, to wit, Pouerty, Chaſtity and Obedience. When the ſouldier deſireth to imitate his Captaine, and to arme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:15101:79"/>
with thoſe weapons which he doth, that he may manfully, according to his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes pleaſure, fight with his enemy, he is worthy both of praiſe and reward. I am the Captaine and Generall of all the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous warfare who haue marched in the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard with theſe three Vertues, and haue ſhewed all my followers, how they ſhould fight with theſe armes I ouercame myne enemies, &amp; triumphed ouer them; &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meet it is, that the Religious, who ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue vnder my colours, and be to fight with the ſame enemyes, ſhould vſe and handle the ſame weapons, which if they do as they ought, they cannot but go out of the field victorious. The ſouldier, who endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to imitate his General, though he arriue not to his great ſtrength and courage, is neuertheles worthy of his reward.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is further requiſite, that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man caſt of all things, that may be of power to hinder his profit of ſpirit. A ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is to do three things, that may make to his profit in humane literature. Firſt, he muſt remoue all the obſtacles and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his ſtudyes, ſuch as be the pleaſures of the fleſh. Secondly ſuch things, as may hinder his true progreſſe in his ſtudyes, and thoſe be the cares of temporall goods, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:15101:79"/>
helps. Thirdly, he muſt make choice of the moſt effectuall and beſt meanes for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his maiſters leſſons, and that is, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to obey his maiſter, and the law of the Schoole. Theſe three obſtacles the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious alſo remoue and take away by the benefit, and help of their Vowes. For by the Vow of Chaſtity they cut off all carnal delights: by that of Pouerty, the ſollicitude of temporall things: and by that of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they fulfill the laws of their inſtitute and their Superiours precepts. To remoue the impediments of this ſpirituall way, is to walke on, and profit in ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sonne, ſith thou art abſolutly reſolued to renounce the world, and all the vanities therof, meet it is, thou giue it ouer, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it in the perfecteſt manner that is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Some leaue it in affection, as do thoſe that haue no deſire of vanities at all, and they do well. Some forſake it indeed, as do they who imbrace a Religious ſtate, and theſe do better. Some againe leaue it both wayes, and they renounce it after a moſt perfect manner, and this do my Religious, when they vow Pouerty, Chaſtity, and Obedience. The further thyne enemy is from thee, the leſſe can he hurt thee.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The world vſeth three ſorts of nets,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:15101:80"/>
wherein many be caught. The firſt net is of gold and ſiluer, that is, of terrene riches, which becauſe it delighteth the eye, is loued of them who are within it, and is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them who are out of it. This net the Religious eſcape by Vow of Pouerty. For pouerty, the veyle of concupiſcence being taken out of ſight, cauſeth, that though the net be made of gold and ſiluer, it ſeeme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a net, and a ſore priſon to be in.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another net is knit of the birdlime of pleaſures of the fleſh, wherein thoſe that be caught, the more they ſtirre, the more be they intangled and woone in it. From out of this net the Religious be deliuered by the Vow of Chaſtity, by the pure and milke white wings whereof they be raiſed aloft; and freed from the cleaning glew of carnall contentments, they become like vnto An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The third net is rather an imaginary and phantaſticke one, then a ſolide &amp; true net, wherein they be caught who preſume of themſelues, and ſeeke after the vayne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and eſtimation of this world. The Religious auoyd this net by the Vow of Obedience, who as they ſubiect themſelues vnto others, ſo thinke they not of imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing any other thing, then humility and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:15101:80"/>
contempt of themſelues. To liue in the world, and to haue beene caught in one of theſe nets, is no great matter; but to liue in in Religion, and to haue fallen into the worlds ſnares and nets, is a caſe to be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly lamented.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There is yet another cauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, that the Religious make the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid three Vowes, becauſe I haue choſen, and called them out of the world for the doing of ſome noble, great, and generous actions, &amp; therfore they need a great, and ſtout cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, which they muſt declare and manifeſt by their worthy deeds: and the height &amp; excellency of the Religious ſtate, wherein I haue placed them, exacteth no leſſe. For a man to be affected to theſe tranſitory and paſſing goods, argueth an abiect and baſe mind: in like manner to take a contentment in the pleaſures of the fleſh, is rather of beaſts then of men. Therfore agreable it is, that Religious be moſt far from both, and this they effect by their Vows, whiles they giue demonſtration of their generous mind, and by exerciſe of vertue auoyding that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto both nature &amp; al the ſenſes do incline.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But Lord, I ſee not, what generoſity is manifeſted by the Vow of Obedience, by which the Religious do wholy ſubiect
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:15101:81"/>
themſelues vnto others. Neither do I well conceiue, how contemptible a matter it is to be affected to riches, and pleaſures of this life, and is not a baſe thing alſo to obey, and ſerue another in the very leaſt, and moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect things.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Sonne, thou eaſily diſcouereſt thy ſelf neither to vnderſtand, nor indifferently to examine matters. For if thou thinke, that the Religious by the Vow of Obedience be ſubiect to others then to me, thou art greatly deceiued. And if thou thinke, that to ſerue in baſe things for loue of me, or to be ſubiect to others by ordination from me, is an abiect thing, thou art much more deceyued. There is a far different manner of liuing in my Court, from that of the World, where the dignity is taken of the office that is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and not of the end or ſcope that is ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at, and therfore all ſeeke rather to haue a power and commaund ouer others, then to be commaunded, and in ſubiection; and all aſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e to dignityes and honours. And becauſe theſe be of greateſt regard with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, therfore they alſo who be poſſeſſed of theſe honours, are in greateſt eſtimation, and be held for great men.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But the caſe is far different. For if the end for which any thing is done, be vile
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:15101:81"/>
and abiect, the actions muſt needs alſo be abiect, and of the ſame nature. And where the louers of the world do all for an abiect end, as for the gaine of money, the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and opinion of a good name, vaine glory, reuenge, and the like, it conſequently followeth, that all their trauayles &amp; actions muſt alſo be held moſt baſe. But in my court the eye and intention is eſpecially bent to the end, which am I, and from me all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions receiue and borrow their worth, and dignity. And where I reward all the actions, that my Religious friends, and children do for loue of me with euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory, none of them ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted either little or abiect, but great and noble. And he who for loue of me ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth himſelfe to another, giueth an euident ſigne of a generous and great mind, becauſe he omitteth nothing, that may be pleaſing to me his Lord.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Wherfore thou muſt not my child, accompt that baſe and vile, which is done for loue of me, and for my glory, becauſe a conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to be had not ſo much of the thing, as of the affection, &amp; end for which it is done. It is not vile and abiect, that maketh an entrance into heauen, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed with an heauenly reward: but
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:15101:82"/>
that is truly vile, which creepeth vpon the earth, cleaueth faſt vnto it, and receiueth what is terrene &amp; earthly, for a compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reward.</p>

                     <p>How Religious Perfection conſiſteth in the three Vowes.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <head>CHAP. V.</head>
                  <p>LORD, if Religious Perfection conſiſt in perfect charity, and the coniunction with the ſupreme Good, which thou art; what need we to buſy our ſelues in other vertues, and leaue that which is our end. Thou knoweſt Lord, that charity is the Queen and Lady of all vertues, and of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth all the law of grace, and therfore if we conuert all our cares, ſtudyes, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the purchaſing therof, we ſhould not labour much about the procuring of other vertues: for if we haue but that one vertue, we can want nothing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is true my Child, that the end &amp; ſcope of Religious perfection is perfect charity, &amp; vnion with me thy Creatour, but how canſt thou be able to attaine the end with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the due meanes vnto it? How wilt thou be vnited with me, vnles thou remoue all the things that hinder thee? Wherfore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:15101:82"/>
thou, that, to that moſt inward v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with thy Creatour, that is, with me, in which perfect charity conſiſteth, thou muſt come by internall affections of mind, conſpiring with the ſpirit of Religion, whereunto thou art called by me. And three things there be, that may hinder the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affection, that it be not conioyned with me.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The firſt is the deſire of riches, and of other goods of Fortune, which when it ſhall once haue ſeazed vpon a part of a mans harts, ſuffereth not the whole man to come vnto me. Wherupon that yong man to whom I ſaid, that if he would be perfect, he ſhould ſell all that he had, and giue it to the poore, and then come and follow me, went his way ſad, becauſe he was ouer much deuoted to his poſſeſſions, which he had, many and great. This affection is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the Vow of pouerty, whereby the Religious renounceth all that be poſſeſſeth in the world, that he may with all his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and loue vnite himſelfe with his Lord.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another impediment and bar, is the loue of carnall and ſenſuall pleaſures, that he cannot ſee to vnite himſelfe with me, which conſiſteth in ſpirituall loue. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:15101:83"/>
in a parable of the Ghoſpell a certaine man being inuited to a wedding, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he could not come, becauſe he had married a wife: and this carnal loue is quite taken away by the Vow of Chaſtity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The third thing that hindreth, and is leſſe acknowledged, is the inordination of mans will, which as it is propenſe to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund others, ſo doth it with much ado ſubiect it ſelf to the will of another. And this inordination is ſuch, as it ſeparateth a man from me, and therfore I ſaid in the Ghoſpel: He that will come after me, let him deny himſelfe, that is, his owne will, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce as it were himſelfe. Neither is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing to be vnited to me, then to forſake himſelfe, &amp; to yeald himſelfe wholy to me; but he laboureth in vaine to vnite himſelfe to me, who doth not firſt of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from himſelfe. This third let is taken away by the Vow of Obedience, by benefit whereof the Religious by ſubiecting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to others, ſuffereth himſelfe to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by the will of others. Seeing then Religious perfection conſiſteth in perfect charity, and an inward coniunction with me, and theſe Vowes be the means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning it, and ordained for remouing the impediments thereof, it is not without
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:15101:83"/>
cauſe affirmed, that in theſe three Vowes Religious perfection conſiſteth.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Moreouer, ſith theſe three Vows be the very foundations of a Religious life, it is not without congruity alſo ſaid, that the perfection therof hath it dependance of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen as the perfection of a materiall edifice dependeth of the foundations. And there be three things in the foundations neceſſary. The one is, that in laying them, there be a ſpecial care &amp; conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had: for the ſurer the foundations be, the more ſtable will be the building. A ſecond thing is, that they be kept whole and ſound, and be not remoued. For by the very leaſt mouing of them, there follow great cracks and ruines in the walls. The third is, that the edifice retayneth not the name of a building, or of an houſe, if the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be wanting, but is called a poore cot, wherinto the ordure and filth is wont to be caſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Seing then the three Vowes be the foundations of Religion, theſe three things alſo ought to be obſerued in them. And firſt that a Religious mans principall care be of his Vowes, for that of them dependeth the life and eſſence of his vocation: and if the Vowes be ſure and ſtable, all the frame of a Religious mans ſpirituall building will
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:15101:84"/>
ſtand ſure and immoueable alſo. Secondly, that the Vowes be conſerued and kept vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayned: for the very leaſt default in the Vowes, cauſeth a notable hurt in Religious diſcipline. Finally, as when the houſes foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being taken away, the houſe forgoeth and looſeth it name: euen ſo the Vowes being away, the Religious is ſaid no more to be Religious, but an Apoſtata, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once fallen from his ſtate, is eaſily ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the filth and dirt of this world. When the rootes of the tree, which are the foundations therof, be hurt, the tree doth ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily either wither away, or is little worth.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Beſides, certaine it is, that Religion is a ſtate, and a place of reſt for the mind, where a man freed from dangerous ſtormes and tempeſts of this world, repoſeth as in a quiet and ſecure harbour, and leadeth a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and peaceable life. And Religion moſt of all compaſſeth this by the help of the Vowes, which intertaine and defend the Religiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> tranquillity and quiet, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering a Religious man from the ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude, care, and trouble of this world: and for this cauſe alſo it is ſaid, that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perfection is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended in the three Vowes.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Wherefore the Vow of Pouerty firſt
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:15101:84"/>
is in cauſe, that a Religious man is exempt from the care of keeping, or increaſing, or alſo of diſpenſing temporall goods. Next, the Vow of Chaſtity freeth him from the care of houſe, of wife, of children and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which is otherwhiles ſo comberſome and tedious, as it bringeth many to deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Finally, by the Vow of obedience there is taken from the Religious the anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, &amp; care, where with moſt men are wont to be vexed, whiles they be not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine and reſolue by themſelues, whether they ſhould do this, or that, whether it would more profit to lead this manner of life, or that. But the Religious, who hath by Vow of Obedience left himſelfe in all things wholy to the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Superiours, is moſt free from ſuch kind of ſuperfluous anxietyes, perplexityes, tentations, and doubts.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Sonne, thou muſt haue a ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to thy tranquillity and peace of mind, for that of it dependeth thy ſoules weale. Where trouble and diſquiet is, there can be neither ſpirit nor deuotion. And know thou, that as long as in Religion thou kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt thy Vowes, they will in like manner keep thee in peace and quiet.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. To conclude, Religious perfection is
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:15101:85"/>
attributed to the Vowes, becauſe it perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth the holocauſt, that the Religious offer of themſelues to God. In the old law the holocauſt was all conſumed with fire for an odour of ſweetnes, and the oblation of it was ſoone ended. But the holocauſt of the Religious continueth for life, &amp; the nearer it is to the end, ſweeter is the ſent thereof, and therfore is to me made a Vow of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Pouerty, perpetuall Chaſtity, and Obedience foreuer. In the holocauſt of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty are offered me all the externall and temporall goods: in that of Chaſtity, the goods of the body: &amp; in that of Obedience, the goods of the mind. For in that the will is offered to me, all the faculties and powers that be in ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to it, be offered withal, and becauſe nothing more remayneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind to be offered, by the Vowes a whole, entire, and perfect holocauſt is not without cauſe offered.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The ſtate of Virgins is perfect in it ſelfe, and very acceptable to me, but the Religious ſtate is much more perfect, and more pleaſing to me, becauſe the Virgins do for loue of me only depriue themſelues of the pleaſures of the fleſh, but Religious fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpoile themſelues of their owne will, and giue me what ſoeuer they haue. He gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:15101:85"/>
not little, who giueth all he hath; neither ſhall he receaue little in heauen, who ſhall for his remuneration and reward receaue me myſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Now I would haue all to be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues iudges in this matter, of how great reckoning the Vowes of Religious ought to be, ſith they be the foundations and ground-worke of Religious life, the conſeruers of the minds tranquillity and quiet, ſo much deſired and ſought for of men, and the moſt effectuall meanes towards the attayning of perfection, &amp; the offering of a perfect ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the Creatour. A ſouldier maketh a great reckoning of his horſe and armes, by the benefit wherof he may be able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his temporall life, and triumph ouer his enemyes. And ſhall not a Religious man eſteeme of his Vowes, by help whereof he conſerueth his ſpirituall life, and goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with victory, not only ouer his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, but ouer himſelfe alſo?</p>
                  <p n="14">14. O how great will the ſplendour of theſe three Vowes be in Heauen, when like vnto three moſt precious ſtones they ſhal be ſet in a crowne of glory? For if the ſame now couered, concealed, and hidden as it were, do neuertheles giue out ſo great a light on earth, as the very great and mighty ones

of this world admire them; how great wil the brightnes therof be in heauen, where all things ſhall be ſeen, and appeare? doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les their ioy and peace of mind will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, who ſhall tranſport theſe iewells with them into heauen: as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe great will be their grief and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, who whiles they liue, had them not in the eſteeme that they ought to haue had.

And all this euill and miſchief ariſeth of this, that they labour on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fulfill the worlds fooliſh lawes, and yet to the performance therof Chriſtians be neither bound, nor tyed by any Vow, but
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:15101:86"/>
be rather by my contrary lawes forbidden to do them, vnder paine of eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And if the men of this world do with ſo great an hazard of their fortunes, life, ſoule, and all, ſo diligently obſerue ſo pernicious Lawes: certes, a Religious man hath much more reaſon to be very ſtudious diligent, and exact in obſeruing the lawes of his vows, which be the ſtatutes &amp; laws of the Holy Ghoſt, that concerne the good of ſoules, and my glory. And in truth he who preferreth the decrees of the world, his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, before the lawes of God, his Creatour, fighteth againſt himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sonne, it is true, that a man is by the world reputed vile &amp; daſtardly, who vſeth not the law of reuenging an iniury: but if for loue of me he remit &amp; forgiue an iniury, he is with me, &amp; withall vertuous perſons cenſured for magnanimous &amp; wiſe, becauſe he ouercometh himſelfe, and regardeth more the lawes of God, then of the world. But he who in Religion tranſgreſſeth his Vowes, is contemned of the world, is held infamous to the Religious, is of all other men condemned for ingrate, for that by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Vows he was raiſed vp vnto ſo high an eſtate, namely of Religion, and by the the ſame enriched with ſo many gifts and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:15101:87"/>
ſpirituall graces. And who ſeeth not, that to violate his Vowes, is nothing els then not to ſtand to his promiſe, nor ſatisfy his band? Who perceiueth it not, that it is as much as to contemne his benefactour and ſetter vp? And therfore the ſaying of the Ghoſpel ought not to ſeem harſh vnto thee, which I pronounced againſt them, when I ſaid, <hi>That he is not apt for the kingdome of heauen, who after putting his hand to the plough, looketh back againe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The beginners are not crowned in heauen, but the perſeuerers in good euen till death. It is alſo ſaid in my Scripture. <hi>That an vnfaythfull promiſe doth greatly diſpleaſe God:</hi> &amp; not without cauſe. For he that diſchargeth not his word in keeping promiſes made by Vow, goeth on next to this, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne Religion, &amp; conſequently the ſame is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned alſo, if it keepeth in it ſuch as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge not their duty. For it is no little ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall vnto men of the world, if they ſee the Religious to be defectiue in euery prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall point, in which conſiſteth the eſſence of Religion it ſelfe. And the leaſt reproach doth not redound to me alſo: for ſith I haue accepted their promiſes made by Vow, if they be not performed as is requiſite, I am vnworthily iniured by them, whome I
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:15101:87"/>
haue ſo tenderly loued, and whome I ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly affected. Beſides the greateſt hurt of all lighteth vpon the tranſgreſſors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, becauſe they caſt themſelues into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt hazard of Apoſtaſy, and into the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſnares, neuer likely to get out againe. And what meruaile it ſometimes in this life alſo I bend the bow of my indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. He that can ſatiſfy the debt that he oweth, and vſeth couſenage that he may not pay it, is worthy neither of remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or pardon, nor of commiſeration. It is a leſſer euill to vow, then to reuoke the vow a man hath once made.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Diuell the capitall enemy of Religious perfection is not ignorant, how much good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to a Religious man by the exact obſeruation of his Vowes. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing bringeth him ſooner, and with more ſecurity to the height of perfection, then the mortification of carnall deſires. And what is it els, in a perfect manner, to performe the Vowes, then for a man to mortify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? The Vow of Pouerty mortifyeth the deſire of heaping vp riches: The Vow of Chaſtity the tentation and contentments of the fleſh; and the Vow of Obedience the facultyes of the mind, the will, and proper iudgment. And this is the cauſe, why the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:15101:88"/>
Diuell laboureth ſo much to perſwade the Religious to make no conſcience, or ſcruple in tranſgreſſion of their Vowes, not only that he may ſo diuert them from the ſeeking of perfection, but alſo for this, that when the foundations be once ſhaken and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is no hard matter for him to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the whole houſe. And an euill ſigne it is, when the beginning of the euill is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and occaſioned by the principall part.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. O how deare be thoſe Religious to me, who ſeeke out diuers meanes, and helps for the attayning of the perfect obſeruation of their Vows, both for the better ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the foundation of their ſpirituall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difice, and for the making of more ſharp warre vpon the Diuel, by manfully reſiſting him. Some there be, who do euery day to themſelues renew the Vow they haue once made to me, and do humbly craue my grace for the perfect obſeruing of them. And this much pleaſeth me? for they eaſily declare &amp; make knowne, how great an inward deſire they haue to auoyd all defects, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their Vowes exactly. By this double deſire of perfect obſeruation of the Vowes, and of crauing grace, the ſoule maketh as it were the firſt ſtep to the obtaining of what it deſireth. Often to renew the Vowes once
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:15101:88"/>
made, is nothing els, then often to driue in the nayles faſter, wherewith the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous be nayled vpon the Croſſe with me, in ſo much as if they begin peraduenture to be looſe, they may be made more faſt. And by this help the Religious be made more ſtrong, able, &amp; more conſtant in obſeruing their Vowes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There be others alſo, whome I loue as well, as the former, who when any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ariſeth againſt their Vowes, do not diſpute with themſelues, whether it were a great fault or a little to do that which the tentation ſuggeſteth, whether it could be done without mortall ſinne, or no; but ſo ſoone as they perceyue it to be contrary to their Vowes, they eftſoons reiect it: no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then he, vpon whome when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture a ſparke of fire falleth, exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, whether it would burne him litle or much, but he inſtantly ſhaketh if off, and putteth it out with his hand, or foot. He that contemneth a little imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he might eaſily auoid, doth in time diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble great ones. Giue eare my Sonne. Didſt not thou make thy Vowes for loue of me, and that therby thou mighſt do me ſeruice? Doeſt not thou keep the ſame, that thou mayeſt gayne the greater fauour at my
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:15101:89"/>
hands? Sith then thou art aſſured, that the very leaſt defects, committted againſt thy Vowes, do diſpleaſe me, wherfore doeſt thou not forbeare to commit them? If in things appertayning to the body, thou do not luſter any fault, neither great nor ſmal, why permitteſt thou any defect in obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Vowes, then which nothing in Religion is more excellent? To do any thing that diſpleaſeth me, though it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little, is not of a zealous louer, ſuch as I deſire euery Religious man ſhould be.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There is yet another meanes, by help wherof the Religious man may come to an exact obſeruation of his Vowes: and this commonly doth he vſe who is feruent in ſpirit, imitating the vſe and manner of ſuch as be very hungry. For they moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſeeke what to eate, and they do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difference eate whatſoeuer they find, whether hoate or cold, well or ill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, roſted or ſodden. Euen ſo the feruent Religious be lead with a great deſire to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thoſe vertues which they haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by Vowes, and this both in great matters and in little, as well in hard and painefull, as in eaſy and pleaſant. And for one to exerciſe himſelfe often in his Vowes, &amp; in the often actions of Pouerty, Chaſtity,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:15101:89"/>
and Obedience, maketh the obſeruation of the Vowes very eaſy. For the frequentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch acts prepareth a Religious man to the getting of an habit. And habit of it owne nature maketh a man agile, prompt, and ready to the exerciſing of Vertue, and conſequently to the obſeruing of his Vowes perfectly. We haue a plaine example in the skill of muſicke, for the more a man fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenteth the exerciſe therof, the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and the more cunningly is he accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſing, or play.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. By this it may be vnderſtood, how greatly and daungerouſly they be deceiued, who care not for light tranſgreſſions in the obſeruation of their Vows, not conſidering or marking, that the eſſence of a Religious man is in his Vowes, that they make or marre, to the good or hurt of their ſoules, that of the ſame depends al the good or euill of religion, ſcandall or edification, and my glory alſo, becauſe the promiſe be made to me; and finally the merit it ſelfe of the three principall vertues, that be comprehended in the Vowes. Wherfore if there be not need of great care, and vigilancy that we fayle not in our duty, I know not in what there will be need. And if a man will not ſhew a feruour and zeale in this thing. I ſee not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:15101:90"/>
wherein he ſhould declare and manifeſt the ſame.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
                  <p>SONNE, meete it is not, that the ſeruant ſhould refuſe what his Lord &amp; Maiſter hath imbraced, neither beſeemeth it the ſcholler to learne another leſſon, then that which his maiſter hath appointed him. Whiles I liued on earth, I choſe, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly imbraced Pouerty. The ſame I taught and propoſed to all that followed me, and now againe I earneſtly recommend it to all, who aſpire to the perfection of ſpirituall life. For I was borne ſo poore, as there was not a corner found in any houſe, that would intertaine and receiue me, when I was to come into the world. And therefore my poore Mother was forced to retire her ſelfe into a ſtable, wherein I was both borne, &amp; layd in a maunger. I was borne of a poore Mother, brought vp as poorely, conuerſed amongſt the poore, and liued poore till my dying day; and at my death I was much
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:15101:90"/>
more poore, becauſe I had not whereupon to reſt my pierced head, and gaue vp my life at laſt vpon the hard bed of the Croſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let the Religious now conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not agreable, that they ſhould be well affected to Pouerty by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> voluntarily promiſed, and ſo highly eſteemed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued by me. Let them ponder, whether it be meet, that members ſo richly adorned and ſet forth, lye hid vnder ſo needy an head. The ſeruant deſerueth not to ſtay in the houſe, who is not contented to vſe the ſame meate, drinke, and cloathing that his Lord vſeth. Neither was I a louer of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty alone, my Apoſtles imbraced the ſame, who beſides that they were poore fiſherme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when I called them out of the world, did further leaue that little which they had and poſſeſſed for loue of me, moſt affectuouſly imbracing Pouerty, as a true and faithfull companion. O how much did it pleaſe me, when being called by me, they did without further lingring, or delay forſake parents, ſhip, nets, &amp; whatſoeuer they had, or might haue in this life. And though this action of Pouerty were great &amp; heroicall in them, becauſe they forſooke all; yet I ſtayed not heere, but would further haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exerciſed in the ſame Pouerty, by liuing with with
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:15101:91"/>
me of the almes of other men, and therfore I ſent them to preach abroad from one place to another, without purſe or ſcrip, prouided of nothing which was neceſſary, that they might repoſe all their hope in Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Religious man the leſſe he hath, and the leſſe deſire he hath of temporall things, is the more apt for the helping of ſoules. And when I did after ſend them forth to preach the Ghoſpell all the world ouer, did they go loaden with baggage, or atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon by great traynes of ſeruants, or did they aduertiſe the citties, whither they went, of their comming, that they might find all manner of thinges prouided and made ready for them? No ſuch matter. But they went full of the holy Ghoſt, loaden with the weight of my doctrine, and incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a burning deſire of conuerting countryes to the fayth: they did like poore men enter into the Citties and Townes, where whiles they made their ſtay, by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching me poore, and naked, dead vpon the Croſſe, they cauſed exceeding motions in their hearers minds. Whome when they ſaw, neither to ſeeke, nor to accept of gold or ſiluer, meruailed much. And when they further ſaw them to take ſo long iournyes al
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:15101:91"/>
the world ouer in extreme penury, and want of things, only for the gayning of the ſoules of others, and alſo to loue want and pouerty; they were almoſt aſtoniſhed with very admiration, and for that cauſe they were more ready, and more eaſily induced to put their neckes vnder the yoake of the Ghoſpell. Theſe two things do not well ſuite, to gaine ſoules, and to attend withall to our priuate commodityes and pleaſures.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If againe, my Sonne, thou turne thy ſelfe to the founders of Religion, thou ſhalt find that they were ſo great louers of Pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as they would not ſuffer the words <hi>Myne</hi> and <hi>Thine</hi> to haue any place amongſt them, thinking that by theſe two words, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed all the force of Pouerty: and if they found any Proprietary amongſt them, they inſtantly baniſhed and thruſt him out, as an infectious perſon from their Company. Let them now ſpeake, who be ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the name of Pouerty, whoſe diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and followers they be: What rule per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to haue goods and prouiſion of their owne? Wherfore do they take paynes to get money togeather, whether to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert it to their owne vſe, or to leaue it to others; howſoeuer they do it, euen ſecular men haue not care to gather riches for any other cauſe.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:15101:92"/>
What difference then is there betweene the Religious men, and thoſe of the world? This is not for a man to beare heauen away by violence, but to afflict and vexe himſelfe for the gathering of earthly traſh togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The doctrine that I haue deliuered is not ſo, neither be they the followers of their founders and forefathers; and ſeeing they trace not the ſame ſteps with them, they will neuer come to the ſame degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that they did.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Lord, if thou giueſt vs not ſome ſpur to put vs forwards to loue Pouerty, it will eaſily be abandoned and forſaken: for ſith it carrieth an outward repreſentation of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, contempt, and baſenes, and of being next vnto miſery, no eſteem is made therof. Sonne, thou art very much deceiued, becauſe thou vſeſt not a diſtinction. In forced Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, &amp; that which commeth of neceſſity, is contemptible, and hated of the world: but voluntary Pouerty, ſith it is a noble and heroicall vertue, how can it be ignoble and baſe? If it treadeth vnder foote, &amp; contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all precious ſtones, and the worlds treaſure, how can it be miſerable? To the loue of it what may moue vs more, then to vnderſtand, that I the Sonne of God, and Lord of Maieſty, when I liued on earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troathed
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:15101:92"/>
Pouerty vnto my ſelfe, and loued and intertayned it till my dying day. And ſhould not this alone worthily induce euery Religious perſon to loue and honour it? For in all Courts, he is in greateſt honour and regard, whome the Prince loueth moſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But wilt thou vnderſtand my Son, who is a true louer of Pouerty? He it is, who moſt delighteth and reioyceth in it, who commendeth, and deſireth it more then other, who thinketh not to offend it either by worke, word, or by any ſigne; who finally imbraceth and loueth it, as an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly margarite, that maketh the ſoule moſt fayre, and beautifull in the ſight of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. O how much did the Religious before tyme to pleaſe me, who were ſo affected to Pouerty, as they held all the riches of this world for toyes and ordure, if they were compared with it. And for a declaration of their exceeding great affection vnto it, they called Pouerty their Lady and Queene, and for ſuch they eſteemed and vſed it. Neither did they this in the firſt feruour of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion only, but the elder they waxed in the ſeruing of God, the more they loued, and reuerenced it, and for that cauſe they were very earneſt and deſirous, that they might giue vp their laſt breath to God vpon
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:15101:93"/>
the bare ground.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. On the contrary ſide, I am not a litle diſpleaſed to ſee ſome Religious ſo little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted to Pouerty, as thoſe, who diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, haue an horrour to it, as a thing to be deteſted, and by deeds alſo go againſt it. Hence it is, that in their meate and drinke, in their cloathing and habitation they will be intreated commodiouſly and daintly, yea &amp; that better and more commodiouſly then they intreated themſelues in the world; and if they haue not euery thing as they liſt, they be troubled, and can take no reſt at all. And what an infelicity is this? They giue ouer the world to ſerue me, they leaue all their riches, neglect their commodityes, and of themſelus vow Pouerty, that they may euer lead a quiet life, and after they be once entred into Religion, they ſuffer themſelues to be diſquieted and troubled for the things that they forſooke in the world. This is nothing but to ſing a ſong of recantation, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke their Vow of perpetuall Pouerty. For what difference is there, whether thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire earthly riches, or ſuperfluous commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and recreations, when as the one and the other be repugnant to Religious Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But it diſpleaſeth me more, that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:15101:93"/>
there be ſome, who not finding in Religion all abundance of things, as they had in the world, do looke backe, and craue their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities firſt of one ſecular man, and then of another, and make themſelues their vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalls and ſlaues. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is it poſſible, that any Religious man ſhould be found, who ſhould bind himſelfe to ſecular men, for the doing of good turnes to others? O infamous madnes of ſuch a Religious perſon, who for ſo baſe a thing maketh himſelf a vaſſal to ſo many! Of this bad fountaine doth ſpring for the moſt part all that looſeneſſe, diſſolution, and breach of good order, and Religious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, which we ſee (a thing to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) in many Religious with our own eyes. Woe be to that Religion, the Religious wherof be no louers of Pouerty, for that by their ouermuch liberty of manners and life they become the ruine and ouerthrow of Religion.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
                  <p>SONNE, I haue not without cauſe in my Ghoſpell amongſt the Beatituds gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the firſt place to Pouerty, and bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed the Kingdome of heauen to the poore, for without Euangelicall perfection it is impoſſible to come to bliſſe. Seing then Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty is the firſt foundation of Euangelicall Perfection, of good right it meriteth the preheminence of the firſt place. For which cauſe I haue ſent all thoſe, whome I haue inuited to follow me, or haue been deſirous of perfection, if they did not of their owne accord renounce the riches of the world, or did not voluntarily become poore, to the firſt foundation, that they ſhould firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all, and then follow me. Perfection would not haue men bound, but free and looſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Lord, if the kingdome of heauen be for the poore, very great will the number of the bleſſed be, becauſe there be more poore in the world, then rich. True it is, my Sonne, that the Kingdome of heauen is for the poore, yet all the poore be not for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:15101:94"/>
heauen, but only thoſe, who make an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be poore, and ſuch be very few. Some there be, who indeed be not poſſeſſed of any thing in this life, yet they haue it in deſire, and this pouerty is not only no vertue nor worthy of praiſe, but alſo ſpoyleth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their eternall felicity, both for that it taketh not away the exceeding deſire of hauing, which is the roote of all euills; and alſo for that it ſetteth it on fire ſo fare, as it maketh a mans mind deuoyd of all manner of peace and quiet: Whence it is, that many become robbers, theeues, and do not admit any cogitation of heauen at all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some be poſſeſſed of great ſtore of riches, but they tye not their affection vnto them, yea they be ready, when it ſhall pleaſe me, and when I ſhall thinke good, to leaue them: and of ſuch poore in ſpirit there be found very few in the world. Finally ſome there be, who that they may be the more free in the exerciſe of true vertue, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne and forſake all earthly riches, not only out of an affection of mind, but by ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of workes alſo. So did my Apoſtles, &amp; many other Religious, who be now in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſion of the riches of heauen. And this is Religious Pouerty, whereunto I haue promiſed the kingdome of heauen,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:15101:95"/>
where all the Religious ſhall be crowned with the moſt noble crowne of glory: but the number of theſe is very ſmall.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the kingdome of heauen could be bought with money, or exchanged with kingdomes and riches of the world, great would be the excellency and dignity of the goods of fortune, and euery one might loue them, as his owne ſoule. This excellency I haue imparted to Religious Pouerty, which of terrene riches maketh a ladder, whereby it may mount vp to heauen. Contrariwiſe the rich of the world dig the earth for the getting of gold and ſiluer out of her bowels, and therein they place and fixe their hart, and bury it with the renouncing of heauen togeather with the true felicity therof. But the poore Religious man, becauſe he dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth his hart to heauen, maketh himſelfe worthy of an heauenly reward. What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way a man ſhall enter into, ſuch ſhall he find the end of it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Beſides, a Religious man by the Vow of Pouerty becometh ſuperiour to the whol world, and aboue it. For whereas he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not to poſſeſſe any thing in this life as his owne, he hath no dependance on the world, or the things therof, but as one aboue it, he contemneth all, that is within the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:15101:95"/>
compaſſe, or power of it. The contrary hapneth to ſuch as be addicted to the world, who be at the commaund of ſo many mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as be the things that they deſire to haue and poſſeſſe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Moreouer Religious Pouerty mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth a certaine power and might againſt the nature of man it ſelfe. For nature deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and inclineth a man to deſire riches, and the commodities of the body, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies of meats, niceneſſe of apparel, ſports paſtimes, and recreations; but Religious Pouerty withdraweth all theſe from it ſelfe for my ſake, and therfore ouercometh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And how then ſhould not I highly eſteeme them, who wittingly and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, moued out of loue of me alone, do depriue themſelues of al theſe lawfull commodities, and whereunto Nature of it ſelfe inuiteth them?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Heare alſo, my Sonne, another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Religious Pouerty. If any needy or poore man become rich by his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, or by any other occaſion, the world meruayleth not: but it wondreth much, if a rich man become voluntarily poore, and ſuch a one indeed, as doeth not only make away his riches, but alſo depriueth himſelf of the power and ability of poſſeſſing them
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:15101:96"/>
fore euer after! And at this the world is aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the more, for that it ſelfe hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in more eſteeme then riches of the world, &amp; ſhunneth nothing with a greater care, then Pouerty. All this proceedeth of nothing els, then that it vnderſtandeth not the dignity and excellency of Religious Pouerty. Let the world tell me: Can it with all it owne riches, and pleaſures ſatiate and fill a mans hart, ſo as it may be at quiet? Nothing leſſe: for that as many as be louers of the world, the more they haue, the more deſire they to haue, and whiles they cannot be ſatisfied with what they haue got, they neuer arriue to any true peace and quiet of mind. But the Religious, who neither haue any thing proper, of their own, nor deſire to haue, liue content with very little. Is not this a certaine participation of euerlaſting felicity, that a man, as he ſhall one day liue content in heauen with the glory therof, ſo liueth now on earth content, &amp; quiet with his Religious Pouerty?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Neither is it the leaſt commendation of Religious Pouerty, that it not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth, and keepeth the Religious, but hath further beene the foundreſſe of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, as many as haue beene, and ſtill be in Gods Church. The monaſteries indeed,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:15101:96"/>
and the Cloiſters be erected and built with money, and the goods of fortune; but the Religious be not founded by them. For the firſt founders, who had ſtore of riches, for the conſecrating of themſelues to my ſeruice did giue away their riches, as impediments to a better courſe of life. And after a good foundation layd of the ſpirit of Pouerty, and of mortification, I vſed them as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors and guids for the drawing of others, and by this means Religions were founded. Stones, and tymber be laid and rayſed by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but vertues are built &amp; raiſed by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But ſuppoſe, that there were not any thing worthy of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, or excellent in Pouerty; is it not a great dignity, that it is loued of me, and eſteemed of me? That it was to me an inſeparable &amp; faſt companion during the whole courſe of my life? That I vſed the help of it in the worlds conuerſion, not by ſending the rich, mighty, and wiſe, but the poore ignorant &amp; rude for the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of the wiſe &amp; mighty of the world? That I wrought ſo great miracles by men poore and abiect for the good of ſoules? Do not theſe ſeeme vnto thee any commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and renowne of Religious pouerty? And if they be great prayſes; haue not I, my
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:15101:97"/>
Sonne, moſt iuſt cauſe to complaine of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who do not only not loue Pouerty, but do alſo without cauſe contemne it? That it is contemned of the world, is no meruayle, becauſe the profeſſion &amp; ſcope therof night and day is to attend to the heaping vp of riches, and increaſing of honours: but that there ſhould be any religious found, who by deeds refuſe the ſame, and vnder hand pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it, is a thing that highly diſpleaſeth me, whiles I behold that Lady and Queen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me by Religious and ſolemne Vow, which ſhould haue a commaunding hand with them, ſo impudently and ſhamefully thruſt out. Spiritual things cannot be loued without a ſpirit.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
                  <p>LORD, what good and profit can Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Pouerty bring, ſith it hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, wherby it may eaſe mans neceſſities? And more then that, in regard of the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modityes that be adioyned therto, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth preiudicial, not to the body alone, but to the ſoule alſo. For the body being ill handled therby, eaſily falleth into ſicknes,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:15101:97"/>
and being ill diſpoſed, cannot ſerue and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the ſpirituall actions of the ſoule, neither can the mind it ſelf vſe the ordinary exerciſe of prayer, and meditation. Beſides it is no little impediment to the Religious, who towards the helping of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, do profeſſe an actiue life. For if they want things neceſſary, they are not able to go through with their labours, in helping their neighbours. Therfore it ſeemeth to me that Pouerty is an impediment to much good, and contrariwiſe promoteth what is ill, as is ſicknes and other infirmities, yea &amp; haſteneth death it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sonne, thou art far wide of thy marke: for thou thinkeſt that Religious Pouerty is a ſeuere and cruell Miſtreſſe that withdraweth from the Religious thinges neceſſary towards their meate, drinke and cloathing, according to a requiſite propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required in their inſtitute. It is not ſo. Pouerty by frugality is good, both for the ſoule &amp; body, &amp; profiteth a man more, then do the riches and pleaſures of the world. For in the firſt place the deſire of tranſitory honours doth ſo torment a mans mind, as it depriueth him of all quiet, pricketh him forward to ſucke vp the bloud of the poore, and bringeth him to ſo great a blindnes, as
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:15101:98"/>
it bereaueth him of all feare of God &amp; men, without any regard had of his owne ſoules good. Neither do men deſirous of getting more, make a ſtand heere.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He that is once become rich, eftſoons raiſeth vp his head, becometh arrogant and proud, vndertaketh to patronize the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and out of a madnes runneth headlong into all naughtines. From theſe euills, and many more, voluntary Pouerty freeth the mind, whiles it doth take from him not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the riches that he hath, but alſo the hope &amp; deſire of hauing, which is the beginning of ruine both of body and ſoule, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth ſuch tranquility and peace, as it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the mind fit and diſpoſed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of heauenly things, and to all manner of ſpirituall actions. Whence it is, that a Religious man, ſo ſoone as he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come poore, conſequently becometh hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, modeſt, meeke, a friend of the good, and of vertue, and an enemy of the bad, and a contemner of vices.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That Pouerty alſo profiteth the body, is out of queſtion. We do not deſire any thing more earneſtly for the body, then good health: and we haue an horrour of nothing more then of ſicknes: for there is not any who would not be rather poore and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:15101:98"/>
whole, then rich and ſicke. And dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience manifeſtly teacheth, that the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of pouerty conſerueth the good health of body, prolongeth and continueth mans life more yeares, then doth all the ſtore of riches and pleaſures. Who ſeeth not, that the poore be more healthfull, &amp; go through with more labours, then do the rich? A poore man is as well content with a ſimple, ordinary, &amp; meane dyet, as be the rich with dainty and delicate fare. The poore man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth euer hungry to his meate: the little that he hath he eateth with a good appetite: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is a thirſt he refuſeth not a draught of watter: after labour he ſeeketh not for a ſoft bed, but he ſleepeth, lyeth downe, &amp; taketh his reſt where it hapneth at aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and in the morning he riſeth early with meate diſgeſted, ſound, and healthfull and without loathing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. On the contrary, the rich man, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the time ordinarily, ſitteth downe to the table with a full ſtomake, taketh very little taſt or pleaſure in his meate, ſcarce ſleepeth by night, but turneth himſelfe euer and anone, now to one ſide of the bed now to another: &amp; therefore the Phiſitian muſt euer be at hand, and drugs prepared in his chamber ready to take vpon euery occaſion.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:15101:99"/>
Loe thus be they turmoiled, who liue in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies: they liue badly, and dye ſoone. My ſeruants did not in times paſt liue ſo in the wilderneſſe, who profeſſed ſo great Pouerty, as ſome when they beſprinckled their herbs with a little ſalt, or oyle, thought they had made a feaſt; and yet theſe men neuer vſing the benefit of Phiſitian, or of phiſicke, liued to very old age, and therfore Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pouerty is not (as thou thinkeſt) the cauſe either of infirmities or of haſtning thy death. Nothing hurteth ones health ſo much, as the variety and abundance of the meate.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Religious Pouerty bringeth another commodity with it, and that is ſecurity, voyd of all ſuſpition, and ſiniſter thoughts. He, that aboundeth in wealth, is afraid of theeues, not only from abroad, but of his own houſe alſo. And not without cauſe: for many, whiles they ſee they cannot come to the riches they deſire, do firſt ſpoyle them of life, and then of their riches. How many ſonnes haue killed or poyſoned their Parents that they might the ſooner come to enioy their inheritance? How many treaſons, &amp; treacheries haue there beene wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt moſt deare friends, for the ſpoiling them of their treaſures? But the poore ſleep
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:15101:99"/>
in ſecurity, they trauayle night and day out of all feare, they are troubled with no ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe they haue nothing to looſe. Adde to this alſo, that Pouerty hindreth none in his trauayle, nor bringeth in, or cauſeth any forgetfulnes of the Kingdome of heauen, which is occaſioned by riches, but rather vrgeth and forceth vs to thinke more often vpon the beauty of our heauenly country, and vpon the great treaſures there prepared for vs.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Lord, at the day of iudgment thou wilt make them only partaker of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, who for loue of thee ſhall haue afforded meate and drink to the needy and ſhal haue holpen them in all their other neceſſities: and what ſoeuer ſhall be done vnto them, thou wilt haue reputed to be done to thy ſelfe. If it be ſo, what reward ſhall come to the poore Religious, who when in their entrance to Religion, they haue renounced all their poſſeſſions, haue not wherewith to relieue them? Wherfore it ſeemeth they might haue done more wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if they had reſerued ſome part of their goods to giue afterward to the poore.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Sonne to giue almes to the poore, is a good worke, and meritorious of life euerlaſting: but it is a far more excellent
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:15101:100"/>
worke for a man to forſake both all his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions &amp; the world alſo, &amp; to follow me. Hence it is, that I did not counſaile that rich yong man in the Ghoſpell, who asked me, what was needfull for him to do to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to a perfect life, to ſtay in the world, and to giue much almes to the poore, but that himſelfe after diſtribution of all his goods vpon the poore, ſhould become alſo poore, &amp; ſo follow me in my Pouerty. And therefore the Religious need not to feare in the day of iudgment: For ſeeing they haue for the loue of me forſaken not only all that they had, but all they might haue had in the world alſo, they exerciſe a moſt noble, and perfect worke, which in that day ſhall be recompenſed and payd with a moſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant reward of euerlaſting felicity. He is not bound to giue almes, who hath diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted all that he had to the poore at once, and hath nothing left him to giue.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Seeing then by the ſo great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and vtilityes of Religious Pouerty it may euidently appeare, that ſecular men be greatly deceiued, who ſeeke with ſo great a deſire to heape vp riches; how great an errour, thinke we, doth a Religious man commit, if he ſhould in like manner ſtudy to get money togeather, who by Vow of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:15101:100"/>
hath renounced it for euer? What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and madnes would it be for him, whiles he forſaketh the world, to haue a will to go out naked, that when he were to fight with the Diuell, he might not haue wherewith his enemy ſhould take hold by, to throw him to the ground, and now to haue a will to be clad in Religion, that he may be with the more eaſe laid hand on, &amp; ouerthrowne by the enemy? The Diuell, when he findeth not whereon to faſten, or to lay any hold, goeth his way ouercome, and vanquiſhed, or leaueth of to moleſt and trouble.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X.</head>
                  <p>SONNE, I am he, who affoard neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes to the whole world: I commaund the Sunne to ſhine as well vpon the good, as the bad: I ſend downe raine in tymes and ſeaſons: I cauſe the earth to bring forth fruits, plants, and all liuing things, and the Sea to abound in fiſh, to the end euery kind according to the condition of their nature may haue helps agreable therunto. Neither doth it beſeem me, the Creatour of all, to be ouercome of man, that he ſhould giue me
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:15101:101"/>
more, then I giue him. And therefore ſith the Religious do by Vow of Pouerty giue themſelues, and whatſoeuer they haue in the world, and to the end they may ſerue me the more readily, and the more at eaſe, they renounce all their poſſeſſions, honors, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and recreations otherwiſe lawful, and further bind themſelues by band of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Vow, that they may not at any time be able to go backe from the profeſſion of Pouerty; meet it is, that I in like manner promiſe to affoard them all neceſſaries for their ſuſtenance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Firſt then I requite this their ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent loue and liberality towards me in ſuch ſort, as I conſecrate my ſelfe wholy vnto them, as I did vndertake long ſince in the perſon of <hi>Aaron</hi> to do, to whome I ſaid, <hi>That I would be his inheritance,</hi> vnderſtanding and meaning in this figure all the Religious. Thus I make my ſelfe their procuratour &amp; diſpenſer. Neither do I hold it inough for my ſelfe to ſuſtayne the perſon of a good Lord towards his faithfull ſeruants, but I further reckon them, as doth a moſt louing Father of his deareſt children. And if the birds and fowles of the ayre be ſo carefull to ſeeke and prouide for neceſſaryes for the feeding of their yong ones; wilt thou haue
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:15101:101"/>
me to forget my Religious children, who do in their Monaſteryes, as in their neaſts, expect their ſuſtenance? Wilt thou not haue them clad with neceſſary cloathing, who haue for my ſake ſpoiled themſelues of all their commodityes of body, retayning no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as their owne? He ſtandeth in need of nothing, of whome God taketh a care.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wherfore know thou, that I haue prouided, and ſtill dayly do, neceſſary helps for all, becauſe neither there be the ſame functions of all, neither do all follow the ſame manner of liuing. For I haue cauſed thoſe, who liue ſeperatly, and, as touching their owne perſon, depriued of al dominion of their poſſeſſions, that they may ſerue me in this degree of Pouerty, to be prouided of poſſeſſions in common, wherof euery one may haue the meanes to entertaine life. Againe, I help others, who haue imbraced the lawes of a more ſtrict Pouerty, in ſo much as they will not euen in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon inioy any ſtable or certaine rents, by mouing the harts of the faithfull, now one, then another to be willing and ready to prouide for euery one conformably to his rule, and vocation.

                  <p n="4">4. And that we may come nearer to the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:15101:102"/>
remuneration, that I make to the Religious in this life alſo, for the recompence of the Vow of Pouerty, tell me, my Sonne, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when any one of thy order cometh fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome foraine part to thy monaſtery for his lodging, all come running to giue him all things neceſſary? For what cauſe is this done? In very deed for no other, then for the Vow of Pouerty, &amp; that is a part of the compenſation, that is due to Religious Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty. If that gueſt ſhould haue any proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his owne, whereof he might liue, euery one would forbeare to help him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would, there want murmurers, who would ſay, this man is rich inough at home, no doubt but he commeth hither to ſpend what is ours, that he might ſpare his owne. But it is nothing ſo. For ſeeing none can be ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that he by reaſon of his Vow of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, neither hath, nor can haue any thing of his owne, therfore al neceſſaries be with charity and good will affoarded him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Againe, with what a company of cars is a ſecular man troubled and turmoyled for the prouiding of his family with ſuch thinges, as peraduenture as appertayne to meate, drinke, and cloaths: how often paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth he whole nights without ſleep, taking care and ſollicitude, where, how, and what

way he may remedy his preſent want? how often lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth he &amp; weepeth, while he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not the meanes to help himſelfe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Doth not he ſeeme, my Sonne, vnto thee happy, who is exempted from all ſuch ſollicitude? Holdeſt not thou him much priuiledged, who deuoyd of cares, hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to procure him all neceſſaryes? And whence haue the Religious this priuiledge but by me, in regard of the Vow of Pouerty.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Conſider alſo, my Sonne, that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man, if it be his happe to trauaile through other countreys, and to come to the houſes of his order, is very kindly and louingly intertayned, and welcomed with much Charity, allthough they neuer ſaw the man before; offer themſelues to do him ſeruice, for this reſpect alone, that they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him to be their brother, &amp; a child of the ſame mother, that is Religion, with them. When he cometh thither, all thinges be there as common vnto him, as they be vnto thoſe, who make their habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there, and therefore for one houſe that he left in the world for the loue of me, he findeth a thouſand other better then his owne. And this is to haue nothing, and yet to poſſeſſe all.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There is not a Prince ſo commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:15101:103"/>
treated as he is when he is out of the territoryes and lymits of his owne gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement. For in his inne he is courteouſly wellcomed, and intertayned by the hoſt of the houſe for no other cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or the gaine he hopeth from him; and whoſoeuer brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not neceſſary prouiſion with him, is wont to make great expenſes, and to beare with many incommodityes, becauſe he taketh not vp his lodging in his own houſe as the Religious doth, and whatſoeuer ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice is done him, it is done for his money, and not for loue, as is done in Religion. Thou now ſeeſt, how much better in this kind the condition of a poore Religious man is, then is that of the mighty &amp; rich, &amp; this for nothing els, but for the Vow of Pouerty, through the benefit wherof he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth many priuiledges, and commodities whereof he was not the authour or cauſe himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is indeed true, that the manner of a Religious mans liuing and intertayning is meane and ſlender, but if thou diligently conſider the conditions of it, thou wilt not doubt to preferre it before the tables and diet of great Princes. For firſt, all that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man eateth, is beſtowed vpon him for the loue of me: all is prepared and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:15101:103"/>
dreſſed of loue: and all out of the ſame loue of my ſeruants brought to the table after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: and whatſoeuer is ſet before him, he eateth and drinketh without any ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all. But what Prince is there in the world, who is ſerued meerely, and purely for the loue of God? In what Princes court be things ſerued in ſo great peace, as in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? Whence come ſo many foretaſts in Princes tables, but of the ſuſpition of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? And who ſeeth not, that a greater eſteeme is to be made of loue and ſecurity wherewith the Religious are ſerued, then of all the magnificall miniſteryes &amp; ſeruices of Princes?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The Religious alſo be not depriued of their wonted attendance, euen in their old age. But he that hath done ſeruice to temporall Lords, when he once commeth to be old, when he is ſcarce of ability to do his wonted offices of ſeruice, though he be not thruſt out of the houſe, is neuertheleſſe hardly endured in the ſight of others, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is vſed according to his deſeruings, though he haue ſpent his whole life in his Lords ſeruice, but is held for an vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon, not fit for any ſeruice. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a poore Religious man, the more he is aduanced in yeares, the more reſpect is had
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:15101:104"/>
of him, and the more commodiouſly is he treated: neither is there conſidered in him, what he doth for the preſent, but what he did before time, and all caſt their eyes vpon him, as vpon my ſeruant, and a man conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to me. Not old age, but an vntoward and peruerſe will cauſeth the Religious to fall from my grace and fauour. A ſpirituall Religious man, and aged, who can take no longer paynes, ſerueth me more profitably, then many ſtrong and able yong men, and thoſe voyd of ſpirit. I in my ſeruants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not ſo much their forces and ſtrength of body, as their will, and ſpirit, which waxeth old, and dyeth not through the fault of age, but of a peruerſe cuſtome.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Finally, a Religious poore man is tended more carefully, more faythfully, and more louingly in ſicknes, then be ſecular Lords. For they obſerue the Phiſitians preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criptions moſt exactly, and there be euer both day and night at hand thoſe who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them in their ſicknes. If there be any daunger of life, they be admoniſhed and put in mind in good time to prepare themſelues to their death. At his dying many of my ſeruants are about him, with their prayers, and good exhortations, aſſiſting him in his happy paſſage to another life. Certes, if a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:15101:104"/>
Religious man were to haue none other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in this life, this alone ought to ſeeme vnto him inough, being ſo ſingular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a thing, as many Princes, and great men of the world haue much deſired it, and yet could not obtayne it. For how many of them haue ended their liues without any preparation going before, for that they were not put in mind of their danger? And how many againe, togeather with their temporall life haue loſt the eternall? And if the reward of my Religious be ſuch in this life, what wil that be, that is prepared for them in the next? What manner of crowne ſhall be giuen them in my Court for the Vow of Pouerty? How many great Lords aſtoniſhed at their exceſſe of glory, will ſay: We eſteemed their Pouerty no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but madnes, but we were mad, and they wiſe indeed?</p>

                  </argument>
                  <head>CHAP. XI.</head>
                  <p>IN my Ghoſpell I reſembled riches vnto thornes, &amp; worthily. For thornes hinder and let trauaylers in their way, that they cannot go on with expedition, becauſe they
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:15101:105"/>
are afraid of the pricking of the thornes. In like manner the thornes taken in hand do pricke, and being preſſed, they draw the bloud, and put a man to payne. Therefore great is the priuiledge of them, who haue left them beind, and whiles they are vpon their way, haue them no more in ſight. For to handle the pricks of the thornes, &amp; not to be prickt, if it be not impoſſible, at leaſt it is very hard, and it profiteth little whether the pricks be great or ſmall, many or few, becauſe all do pricke, and euer pricke: Euen ſo riches do greatly hinder ſuch as trauayle towards heauen, and do weary a man much with the bearing of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To haue any thing proper, and not to be affected vnto it, is not graunted to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, much leſſe to all. The affection is that, which bringeth forth the thorns of cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſuſpitions, &amp; cares of gathering riches togeather, whereunto the more a man ſhall giue his mind, the more ſhall he be prickt and be bloudy himſelfe. Wherfore not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in riches, or to be bound to leaue them, is an exceeding great benefit, and in it conſiſteth the Vow of Religious Pouerty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But it is not inough, Sonne, to make Vowes, if they be not performed; for that the end of a Vow is to obſerue it by deeds &amp;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:15101:105"/>
actions. Remember therfore, that thou art bound of thyne owne accord to perpetuall Pouerty (which amongſt the morall and religious vertues is the principall) and that the obligation was made in my ſight. But by contrary works to exempt thy ſelfe from thy Vow, is nothing els, then to denounce war againſt the chiefeſt vertue of al, which thou haſt choſen for thy Lady, and Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and therby ſo to incurre the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of violating thy obligation, that is, euerlaſting damnation, &amp; to offend me thy Creatour and Benefactour, who accepted thy Vow. And now iudge thou, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is for thee to ſtand to thy promiſes once made to me, which as they profit to ſaluation when they be well kept, ſo being broken they damne eternally.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Lord, ſeeing riches be ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and dangerous, and yet a man needeth meate, drinke, and cloathing neceſſary to the ſuſtentation of life, it ſhould be inough for thee, if we ſhould at leaſt be in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe poore, whome holy writ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth in theſe words: <hi>Bleſſed is the man, who hath not gone after gold, nor hath put his hope in the treaſures of money:</hi> For ſo we might be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ſome neceſſary things, the affection being remoued from the money, without
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:15101:106"/>
preiudice or breach of the Vow of Pouerty. It is true, Sonne, that <hi>Bleſſed is he who is not gone after gold:</hi> but the Scripture addeth by and by after: <hi>VVho is he, and we will prayſe him?</hi> Who is he that deſireth not gold? Who is he that deſireth not to keep it, after he hath got it, and alſo to increaſe it? If thou go not after gold, gold will come after thee, and will like vnto thorns cleaue faſt to thy cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, &amp; though it pricke thee not, yet will it hinder thy going. Wherefore the Vow of Pouerty quite debarreth all poſſeſſion of ones owne, whether it be much or little. Neither muſt thou be ſollicitous about thy meate, drinke, and cloathing: leaue that care to me, let thine endeauour only be to ſatisfy thy Vow of Pouerty, and I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide other neceſſaries. Who putteth his hope in any other then God, he doth God an iniury, and ſhall find himſelfe deceiued.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Remember that Pouerty is called the wall of Religion, and the mother of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. As long as a Citties wall is ſound and whole, it is eaſily defended and kept from the incurſion of theeues, and enemies, but if it be broken downe, or be decayed, the enemy eaſily breaketh in, and ſpoyleth it. Euen ſo Pouerty, which is the wall of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious diſcipline, if it be either contemned
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:15101:106"/>
or neglected, ſo as ſome propriety be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becometh obnoxious and ſubiect to the enemyes ſpoyle. And therfore need there is, thou keep and defend the wall, if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to keep and gard thy ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Who in time of warre watcheth v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the walls, muſt haue two conditions. One that he watch, the other that he ſuffer not himſelf to be wonne with bribes. Theſe two conditions be in a Religious man, that voluntarily imbraceth Pouerty, who liuing ſparingly, is not moleſted, or ouerpreſſed with troubles in his ſleep, and becauſe he is not a proprietary, his enemys do not eaſily corrupt him with brybes. Wherfore there is not a more vigilant keeper, nor a more ſtout defender of the wall of Religion, then a truely Religious poore man. Beſides, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is, that the Citty walls be often looked vpon, that where and when need is, they may be repaired, and ſtrengthned. For if they ſhall begin once either to decay, or to bend and incline to one part, a remedy will hardly be found. So the Pouerty of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt often be examined, and looked into, that it be not in any part looſened, and if it happen to be, that it be repayred againe. For ſo Religion will be more ſtrongly fortified, and the ſtate therof the more ſecured. For
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:15101:107"/>
as the firſt drift of the enemy is to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and ouerthrow the walls of ſome bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke; ſo the greateſt care of them, who defend it, muſt be, that the walls be conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and kept.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is alſo called the mother of the Religious, becauſe Pouerty is that which firſt communicateth to a Religious man his very eſſence and nature, and nouriſheth and bringeth him vp. True it is, that ſhe is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſeuere in the educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her children, not for that ſhe withdraweth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them ſome commodityes neceſſary, but rather ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: yet ſhe doth it for a good end, namely, that her children may become valiant ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; and fight manfully againſt all kind of vices. For ſhe well knoweth, that a man brought vp in delicacy, and nothing accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to the enduring of labours, cannot be a good ſouldier Amongſt the conditions of this mother one is, that to her children that loue her, ſhe is deare and gratefull, and to them that loue her not, ſeuere and ſterne; and whoſoeuer is bound to be vnder the gouernment of ſuch a Mother, if he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to accommodate himſelfe vnto her, he ſhall not be without a continuall affliction all his life long.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If it diſpleaſe thee, Sonne, to haue
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:15101:107"/>
ſuch a Mother, remember that Pouerty hath not choſen thee for her Sonne, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywiſe, that thou haſt choſen her for thy Mother, &amp; ſhe accepted thee for her Sonne. Thou alſo in regard of thy Vow ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> bound perpetually to lead thy life with ſuch a Mother, and therfore it is not any longer in thy power to leaue her off, thou being bound to loue, honour, and defend her. Tell me, ſhould not that Sonne ſinne grieuouſly, who ſhould handle his Mother ill &amp; rudely, or ſhould thruſt her out of her houſe? And what other thing is it for thee to enioy and vſe ſome little thinges for the ſatisfying of thyne owne deſire, but wickedly to handle thy Mother, Pouerty? And nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard her, what is it els, then to driue her out of thy hart, which is her habitation, and houſe to dwell in? Take heed, my Sonne, what thou doſt, becauſe all the hurt retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vpon thine owne head, ſith it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that ſhe needeth not thy ſeruice, but thou needeſt her help; neither canſt thou lead a Religious life without her: ſhe is not bound to thee, but thou to her. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen belongeth to the poore, but he that will not know Pouerty for his Mother, ſhall neither haue part in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance which is the kingdom of heauen.</p>

                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:15101:108"/>9. Lord, I know and vnderſtand wel, that to make the Vow of Pouerty, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, then to promiſe to thy maieſty, that I neither will haue, nor haue a will to haue any thing proper, and will lead my life in Pouerty. But I long to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I can ſatisfy my Vow of Pouerty, if I poſſeſſe nothing of myne owne, and yet all things are pleaſing vnto me, and agreable to my manner of doing.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Sonne, as it pleaſeth me, that euery one be prouided of thinges neceſſary: ſo it diſpleaſeth me, if a Religious man either haue, or procureth to haue ſuperfluityes. But what is neceſſary, or profitable, it is not for thee to iudge (for we be eaſily begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by our ſenſes, or our owne affection) but thy Superiour. It is for the Superiour to iudge, what is conuenient for Pouerty. He is not poore who wanteth nothing, neither liueth he after the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of the poore, who hath all things, as he liſteth.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
                  <p>SONNE, he that is prouided of rents af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of poore, &amp; yet will, like
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:15101:108"/>
vnto the rich, make great expences, goeth greatly awry: for he ſhall within a while find himſelfe ſo ſorely engaged, as he muſt be forced to lye in priſon, and there be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, vntill he ſhall haue payed the very laſt farthing. Whatſoeuer thou haſt in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is giuen thee by me, and for me, and I haue giuen it thee, as to a poore man for thy vſe, and neceſſary for thy Religion. But if thou wilt vſe, and ſpend the thinges of Religion, after the manner of the rich, at thyne owne will, as though thou wert an abſolute owner thereof, it will fall out ill with thee, becauſe thou art one day to giue a ſtrait accompt of all. Thou haſt forſaken all that thou haſt in the world, and that thou mighteſt not vſe them at thyne owne will, thou art ſpoiled of them: Why then doeſt thou in Religion thinke to vſurpe a dominion vpon another mans goods, and to diſpoſe of them at thy liſt? This, certes, is neither conuenient, nor pleaſing to me. Wherfore thou muſt needs reſolue to vſe the thinges of Religion, as my things, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to me, and what is transferred to thy owne vſe, thou art to handle not as thine, but as myne, allowed of me to thee by thy Superiour, and that to ſerue thy vſe as long as it ſhall pleaſe me, ſo as it is in my
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:15101:109"/>
will to take it from thee, when it ſhall to me ſeeme good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It doth diſpleaſe me much, when a Religious man is tranſported with ſo great a deſire to ſomething that is permitted him to vſe, as he can hardly forgoe it againe, when reaſon requireth. For what manner of beaſt ſhould that be, who being hired to beare burdens, would not haue the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments afterward taken from him, that were fit to beare the burden with eaſe? Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer Religion aſſigneth to euery one, it doth it for my ſeruice, &amp; whether I would take ſomething away from any, or permit him to vſe it ſtill, he muſt not be therefore grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or troubled. An ouer great affection to thinges lent, maketh them to become ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. O how much do thoſe Religious offend me, who be aſhamed to be poore, &amp; to weare a poore garment, or to vſe a ſlender dyet. For how can it be they ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed for that, which is to them a glory, by the benefit whereof they are raiſed to ſo high a ſtate, and maketh them like their Lord and Maiſter? Could they be forgetfull of their promiſe made of Pouerty? If they haue not forgotten it, wherefore do they ſo lightly eſteeme it? What man is there in the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:15101:109"/>
world, who would be aſhamed of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion? And ſith the Religious man hath made a profeſſion of Pouerty, and that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliquely, what is the cauſe, that he is aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it? Some ſeruants of myne did not ſo who now enioy eternall felicity in heauen, who were rather confounded, if they found any more poore then themſelues. Who is aſhamed of vertue, plainely declareth that he loueth it not. An euill ſigne it is to hate Pouerty, which is a principall vertue, and proper to Religious life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There be others, who are aſhamed of their parents pouerty; and ſome againe who brag and boaſt of their riches, and both of theſe be affections of a Religious man ill mortified. That the Parents be rich, is not a vertue, wherfore then ſhould a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man glory of them? Yea the richer they be, in the greater danger be the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, leaſt they one day looke backe, and for that cauſe they haue greater matter of feare, then of glorying. And that thy parents be poore, was it through any fault of thyne? &amp; if not, wherfor ſhouldſt thou be aſhamed, or afflicted for it? If to be poore in the world ſhould be a crime, thou ſhouldeſt haue a iuſt cauſe of confuſion: but it is not. Or if Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty ſhould make the way to heauen more
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:15101:110"/>
hard, thou mightſt worthily be ſory, and complaine: but it is more then certaine, that the coming to it is made hard, not by Pouerty and want, but by riches. Wilt thou haue thy Patents rich? Procure then that they may be vertuous, &amp; content with their eſtate: for ſo they ſhall be in Gods grace and friendſhip, which by many degrees ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all the riches and honours of this life. The Religious man that hath a deſire his Parents ſhould be great and honorable in the world, and laboureth not that they be prouided of ſpirituall riches, ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to haue very little charity, and no ſpirit at all.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is alſo a ſore defect in the Vow of Pouerty, if a man thinke he hath done inough, when he poſſeſſeth nothing as his owne, and in the meane time is ſollicitous, that he may want nothing. Certes, I ſee not how there can be any coherence betweene theſe two. To make a Vow of Pouerty, and not to haue a will to make a tryall of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty: To be poore, and not to be willing to try the effect of it: To loue Pouerty, &amp; yet to haue a will to be far off from it. I was my ſelfe poore, for that in the whole courſe of my life I experienced the effects of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, by ſuffering hunger, thirſt, heat, cold,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:15101:110"/>
wearines, nakednes, and a thouſand incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modityes. I loued Pouerty, and therefore I would haue it to accompany me to my Croſſe, where I was nayled naked vnto it. My Apoſtles alſo, and ſome of my diſciples and followers ſuffred many incommodities of Pouerty, euen vntill their dying day. But thou not only ſeekeſt no occaſion of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any thing, after the manner of poore perſons, in thy meate, drinke, &amp; cloathing, but further moſt carefully, and importunely thou ſeekeſt for what is beſt, and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, and if thou haue it not, thou art troubled, and murmureſt for it, and which is worſe, thou oftentymes pretendeſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and health, when it is thy meere ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. He is not poore, who ſhunneth the incommodityes of the poore. O how did thoſe Religious pleaſe me, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were deſtitute of ordinary things, and of neceſſary ſometimes alſo, yet complained not, nor were ſory for it, but with ioy ſayd: This is to be a poore one of Chriſt, his name be euer bleſſed for it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Thoſe alſo, who are not content with the common entertainment of Religion, but without iuſt cauſe deſire either ſome particularityes, or not neceſſaryes, do ſorely weaken, yea and ouerthrow their Vow of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:15101:111"/>
Pouerty. For in the one there is meere ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity; in the other there be made expenſes without neceſſity, and both of them be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Pouerty, whereof it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſayd, <hi>As much as is inough, and no more.</hi> To vſe parſimony in the things of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to ſpend them but when neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, is not miſery (as the haters of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty will haue it) but an act of vertue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Pouerty exacteth it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is alſo a vice and fault, repugnant to Religious Pouerty, both to take thinges without the Superiours leaue, and to giue them vnto others. For whatſoeuer is giuen to a Religious man, is the Religious, not the mans, who cannot haue any thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and therfore if he accepteth of gifts, he ſheweth himſelfe a proprietary: ſo if he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth any thing to another, he maketh a ſhew that himſelfe is the owner therof, and both the one and the other, that is, propriety, &amp; dominion be repugnant to Religious Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty. Neither is that Religious man alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather free from fault, who accepteth, or giueth things of very little value, ſith in the Vow of Pouerty there is not any excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of things little or great, but he hath abſolutly promiſed, that he will not vſurpe any propriety in any thing, either
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:15101:111"/>
little or great, nor take any dominion to himſelfe therein. An errour in little and light things, doth not for go the name of an errour.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Finally Pouerty is an hurt, when the expenſes be ſuperfluous, and the thinges that be bought, be rather curious and faire, then profitable and neceſſary. He that is truely poore, and imbraceth Pouerty with ſincerity, laboureth to do what it required and no more. For what difference is it for a religious man to haue a faire guilded book or a garment ſowed with ſilke; when as a booke not guilded might ſerue him as well as guilded, and a garment ſown with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thrid, would be as good for him, as ſowne with ſilke? And if the one conſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth more with Pouerty, then the other, why will he not conforme himſelfe to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty? In like manner tell me, I pray thee, what is the cauſe, that a Religious man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth and keepeth other mens things in his chamber, that do him no good, and yet might profit others? Is not that ſuperfluous, that hindreth anothers good?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Sonne, thou haſt a deſire to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into the number of the poore, either in earth or in heauen. If in earth, it is inough that thou haſt made a Vow of Pouerty, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:15101:112"/>
be reckoned amongſt the poore, and if in heauen, it is not inough, but further there is required thou be poore in deed, that is, that thou cut off all ſuperfluityes, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thy ſelfe continually euen till death in the acts of Pouerty, and this is to be a true Religious man. He is not to be numbred in the company of my poore, who will abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in ſuperfluityes, neither ſhall he come to the reward of the poore, who ſhall not haue made a tryall of the effects of Pouerty.</p>

                  <p>SONNE, if the vertue of Chaſtity were not, it would be greatly amiſſe with man ſith the concupiſcence of the fleſh is of that nature and condition, that if it were not reſtrayned in time, it would make a man (otherwiſe indued with reaſon and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) in a ſhort time like a brute beaſt.

Another condition of concupiſcence is, that there is no good which a ſenſual man contemneth not, nor any euill that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth not, ſo he may enioy and compaſſe what he vnlawfully deſireth. He hath no regard or conſideration of riches, which for the ſatisfying of his luſt and ſenſuality, he waſteth not: he expoſeth his life to a thouſand daungers: he hath no care of his health at all: he reſpecteth not the doing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his conſcience, and to hurt his owne ſoule, ſo he may enioy his deſires.

ſenſuall and beaſtly, who exerciſeth beaſtly actions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third condition of concupiſcence is, that it is neuer ſatisfyed, but increaſeth more and more by ſenſuall pleaſures, and ſetteth the body ſo on fire, as no feuer though neuer ſo burning and hoate, ſo ſore tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a man, as doth the concupiſcence; nor any fury of hel is ſo turmoyled, or in ſo great torments, as is a luxurious man, whoſe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and raging heate is ſo great, as it may ſeeme not poſſible to be extinguiſhed, but by death. The fleſh firſt tyeth a man faſt, next it blindeth him, and laſtly it tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him. Who hath no will to be thus han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, let him not put himſelf into the fleſhes tormenting hands.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. With this peſtiferous, and vnruly wild beaſt the vertue of Chaſtity is to make warre, who being called on for her ayde, willingly preſenteth her ſelfe, &amp; greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the fury of this beaſt, and abateth the concupiſcences heat. Wherfore it is the generall office and charge of Chaſtity to moderate and direct all the deſires of the ſenſes according to the rule of reaſon, by yealding vnto euery degree of Continency what is conuenient and no more. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there be diuers degrees of Continency,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:15101:116"/>
there be alſo diuers permiſſions and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions therof which ſhe preſcribeth. In the firſt and loweſt degree is the continency of the married, who are only forbidden vnlawfull pleaſures. In the ſecond is that of widowes; in the third that of the ſingle and vnmarried, who do not only renounce vnlawfull pleaſures of the fleſh, but alſo the lawfull which they might enioy without ſinne, if they had a will to marry. In the fourth degree is Continency of Virgins, which as it is more perfect then the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, ſo deſerueth it a greater reward, the perfection wherof conſiſteth not only in a firme purpoſe of contayning from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of venereous pleaſures, but alſo in the perpetual conſeruation of virginal Chaſtity. In the fifth and higheſt degree is placed the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinency of religious, which though it be not ſometymes Virginall, is yet in perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more excellent then the reſt, for that it is by Vow conſecrated vnto me, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an act of excellent Charity, and of the greateſt of all the morall vertue, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely of Religion, cauſeth greateſt perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and excellency to Religious Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Now the law of Chaſtity comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Religious Continency to exerciſe three
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:15101:117"/>
offices worthy of it ſelfe. The firſt is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the purity of the fleſh, whereunto is required a great courage. For ſith the fleſh of it ſelfe is prone to incontinency, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, a great alacrity and courage of mind is neceſſary towards the keeping of it vnder, that a man, who naturally loueth and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourech his owne fleſh, nor eaſily ſuffereth it to be afflicted, giue it not the bridle ouer much, nor plunge himſelfe into the myre &amp; puddle of carnall pleaſures. A ſecond office is to keep a gard ouer the ſenſes, and therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to needeth vigilancy, and diligence. For ſeing the ſenſes be wandring and ſlipery, &amp; preſent a thouſand occaſions of ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, vnles a Religious man ſhal be very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in keeping them, they will eaſily breake out beyond their bands. The third office is to conſerue the purity of the mind vnſtayned, wherein circumſpection is very neceſſary for the conſidering &amp; examining of what is admitted thereunto. And if there be any thing that may ſtayne or infect, it muſt be kept out, for that it is more eaſy to keep it from entring, then to thruſt it out, after it be entred.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Sonne, this is the law of Religious Chaſtity, and theſe be the offices thereof. If thou deſire to be holpen thereby, ſeeing
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:15101:117"/>
for that end thou requireſt the ayde of it, thou muſt alſo needs fauour it, and not deny it thyne help, that it may diſcharge it owne office. If thou ſhouldſt deny this thou ſhouldſt do, as if thou calledſt a Phiſitian home vnto thee, but wouldſt not haue him to touch the ſicke mans wound for feare of the payne, or loathing that would follow. This is not the way of curing the ſicke bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but of increaſing his ſicknes rather. The body inured to pleaſure, is wont to complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, that Chaſtity is euer exact and ſeuere in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the precepts of her laws, which forbids many things and permits few. But theſe be the complaints of the nyce, delicate and ſenſuall ſicke, who ordinarily deſire &amp; long for the thinges that be moſt hurtfull vnto them, which if they be yealded vnto, do hurt them, and therefore ſuch things be more diſcretly denyed them. Suffer the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian my Sonne, to put his hand to the yron; for the loathſome ſore of carnall concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, vnles it be launced in tyme, will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grow to a feſtred, and peſtiferous impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume. He that will not with a very little payne be cured as he ought, ſhall be els where eternally tormented, as he deſerueth.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <head>CHAP. XIIII.</head>
                  <p>SONNE, man conſiſteth of two parts, the owne called the inferiour and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall, appertayning to the body; the other the ſuperiour and reaſonable, appertayning to the ſoule. When he was created in the terreſtriall Paradiſe, as long as he continued in his ſtate of innocency, he enioyed great peace alſo, becauſe the inferiour part was in perfect ſubiection, and obeyed the ſuperiour part, neither was it ſo hardy as to reſiſt. But after that man did by ſinne make reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance againſt his Creatours will, he fell from that happy and peacable ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, &amp; the inferiour part began to rebell againſt the ſuperiour, that is Reaſon: and hauing alſo, out of a pride, a will to vſurpe her authority, it fell alſo ſhamefully; for that reiecting the counſaile of Reaſon, it began to attend wholy to pleaſures. Hence aroſe the warre, that is now made between the Senſe, and Reaſon. By this, man became ſpoyled of his former peace and tranquility &amp; for that cauſe he was driuen to gard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the help of vertues for the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of ſenſuality vnder the ſubiection of Reaſon. And amongſt theſe vertues Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:15101:118"/>
hath a principall place, which if it once find an entrance into Reaſons king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and into the ſuperiour part of the ſoule, like a prudent and wiſe Lady ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the ſenſuall part to hold it ſelfe within it owne bounds, and to yeald ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignity to reaſon. Hence it is, that the firſt excellency of Chaſtity is to reſtore man, as much as may be, into his former ſtate and poſſeſſion of innocency wherein he was created, and to honour him with that orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of purity, which he did weare before in the terreſtriall Paradiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chaſtity is alſo called an Angelicall vertue, becauſe it maketh man like vnto an Angell, while it cauſeth him to lead an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels life. For though man of his own nature be in the middeſt between Angels &amp; beaſts, for that the conditions of both haue place in him; though he be ſuperiour to theſe, &amp; inferiour to thoſe, yet is he ſomtymes beaſt-like, ſometimes againe Angel-like. Beaſt-like, when the ſenſuality in the encounter with the ſuperiour part, goeth away with victory, and hath a commaunding hand ouer Reaſon, and cauſeth a man to plunge himſelf ſo deep in the boggs of terrene plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as he maketh himſelfe vncapable of the heauenly, &amp; as a brute beaſt, reciueth no
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:15101:119"/>
taſt of ſpirituall matter at all. But when Chaſtity is once got into the kingdome of the mind, the warre commeth to a far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent concluſion. For Chaſtity in the firſt place layeth hand vpon ſenſuality, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth her, and ſetteth Reaſon in her owne place and authority of gouernment and commaund. Next it prouideth that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hold the fleſh vnder, and in ſubiection, and this is to be Angell-like. And though a man be agreably to his nature faſt tyed to his fleſh, and whiles he is in this baniſhment, trauayleth vp and downe in fleſh, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe through benefit of Chaſtity he liueth not according to the fleſh, he is ſaid to lead an Angells life. And he that on earth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth as an Angell, ſhall in heauen ſhine alſo as the Angells do.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Againe, Chaſtity raiſeth a man vp to the performing of great and wonderfull thinges: contrariwiſe the intemperance of the fleſh abuſeth him to abiect &amp; moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible things. Experience teacheth, that ſuch as purſue the fleſhes pleaſures, do not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to the effecting of noble and heroicall matters, and more then that, whiles they ſee themſelues faſt tyed and caught in the fleſhs ſnares, they drowne themſelues ouer head and cares in the puddle of luſts. This vice
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:15101:119"/>
alſo ſo dulleth mans wit, as it doth not only lay a bar and impediment to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe and profiting in diſcipline and arts, but alſo bringeth in a forgetfullnes of thoſe thinges that were learned before. On the contrary ſide, Chaſtity as it is an Angelicall and celeſtiall vertue, ſo doth it rayſe a man to the execution of generous and moſt noble workes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The founders of Religions, if they had not lead chaſt liues, had neuer gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſo great, and hard matters, as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of new Religions be: neither could the Apoſtles, when they preached the Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, haue moued the world, or haue done other great matters, which they did, if they had been cumbred with wiues &amp; children. Thoſe therfore who imbrace purity both of mind and body, be more apt to receaue the cleare light of my grace, to contemplate matters of heauen, the myſteries of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, the bleſſed Spirits, the greatnes and excellency of the eternall felicity, and of the goods prepared for the vertuous in heauen. Whence it is, that man alſo, though ſtill li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in a mortall body, if he conſerue his integrity of body and mind, doth euen now in part begin to enioy the pleaſures of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:15101:120"/>5. Neither is this the leaſt of Chaſtities excellencyes, that it ſo beautifieth and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth a mans ſoule, as it maketh it moſt gratefull to myne eyes. For though all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues adorne the ſoule, and euery one giue it a particuler ornament, yet Chaſtity, becauſe it conſerueth it from all ſtayne of the fleſh, maketh it moſt pure and moſt beautifull: as contrary wiſe the vice of the fleſh maketh it ſo fowle and vgly, as though it be prouided of all other moral vertues, yet may it hardly be endured. The externall beauty of times is an occaſion of the ſoules perdition: but Chaſtity, which is the ſoules beauty, beſides that, that it is moſt acceptable to God, procureth both the ſoules and bodyes good togeather.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Finally Religious Chaſtity, though it be of it ſelfe noble &amp; excellent, receyueth yet greater ſplendour and perfection from many other thinges. For firſt it is greatly ennobled by Vow, by vertue whereof a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man hath renounced all kind of pleaſures, whether the ſame appertayne to the body and ſenſes, or to the mind and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall facultyes therof. Againe it boroweth no ſmal excellency from the very fountaine and origen thereof, which is a ſincere and perfect loue of me. For a Religious man
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:15101:120"/>
moued not of any neceſſity, or hope of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, nor for any other human reſpect is induced to forſake all pleaſures of the fleſh, but only for the pleaſing of me. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Religious Chaſtity is the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable for this, becauſe it is endued with moſt perfect Charity, which is the nurſe and mother thereof. No little ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and perfection alſo is added vnto it by the end and ſcope that Religious Chaſtity hath propoſed: and this end is nothing els, then my honour and glory, and therfore the Religious bind themſelues to perpetuall Chaſtity, for that by it Gods ſeruice is in a wonderfull ſort amplified, and ſo it is no meruayle, though Religious Chaſtity chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth the firſt place amongſt all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Chaſtity. The more excellent and perfect Chaſtity is, the more it communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth to them that loue it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Wherefore, Sonne, ſeeing Chaſtity is ſo noble &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, I do not hold it inough if thou imbrace it after a meane manner, or haue an earneſt deſire vnto it, as to a moſt precious Iewell; but I could rather wiſh, thou wouldeſt alſo conſecrate thy ſelfe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as to a thing, that did moſt of al pleaſe me. And know thou, that I do aboue all things loue a pure and chaſt hart, and loue
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:15101:121"/>
it ſo affectuouſly, as I not only with a ſingular ioy repoſe therin, &amp; enrich it with ſundry gifts, but alſo nothing can be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of me, that I do not gratiouſly impart vnto it. And this alone ſhould ſet euery Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious mans mind on fire to deſire this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly gemme, wonderfully ſhining, not only in the company of vertues on earth, but alſo in heauen amongſt the company of the bleſſed. The more tenderly thou ſhalt loue Chaſtity, the more thou ſhalt be loued of God, and if thou canſt not loue it, as much as it deſerueth, at leaſt loue it in what thou art able.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XV.</head>
                  <p>LORD, I well vnderſtand, that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conuenient, that he be chaſt, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to thy ſeruice, conſidering by the benefit of his Vow he is conſecrated and bound to thee, the fountaine of all purity. It is nothing agreable, that vnder a cleane and pure head the members ſhould be filthy and fowle. But I know not how I may long defend my Chaſtity, ſith I haue at home a capitall enemy, who truſting to both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:15101:121"/>
and outward helps, becometh ſo ſtout &amp; hardy, as I almoſt deſpaire of the victory. Now thou knoweſt, o Lord, how ſore this inſolent and proud fleſh perſecuteth the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my ſoule. Thou art not ignorant, how many aſſaults it maketh night and day vpon it. And yet this doth not make me afraid. Another thing perplexeth and troubleth me much more, that is, that both the wantoneſſe and rebellion of the ſenſes within, and the moſt cruell enemy Sathan without, do miniſter helps vnto it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sonne, what thou ſayſt is moſt true, but thou muſt not be diſmayd for it: for the greater that the enemies boldnes &amp; poweris, the more glorious wil the victory &amp; crown be that followeth after. Neither ſhalt thou want my help, only play thou the man, and vſe all thy forces for the maintayning of Chaſtity, and no enemy from within or without ſhall get the victory from thee. And ſeeing thou acknowledgeſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeſt alſo, that it is conuenient, that my Religious ſeruants be chaſt, as I their Lord am; know thou that I was euer ſo harty a louer of purity, as myne aduerſaries, who calumniated me in very many things, durſt not accuſe or condemne me of the very leaſt defect againſt Chaſtity. And that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:15101:122"/>
ought to be ſuch their ſtate exacteth, ſith they make a profeſſion to be my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, &amp; imitators of my life. Wherfore ſeing I was exceedingly affected to this vertue of Chaſtity, and regarded it as the guid of a ſpirituall life, requiſite it is, that they alſo imbrace and take it for their Lady and Miſtreſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And becauſe I make ſo high an eſteem of purity, and am in the higheſt degree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted from the vice of concupiſcence, why wouldſt thou haue me to entertayne a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt ſeruant within my houſe? or that I ſhould endure him in the ſame? How ſhould I ſuffer, that any ſeruice ſhould be done me by him, whom I know to haue an vncleane mind? The ſeruant that accommodateth not himſelfe to his Lord and Maiſter, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecteth to procure his loue and good will, either will not be long ſtable in his office, or if he continue in it, will make very little profit therby, and will put himſelfe in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being thruſt out, to his owne great hurt, and no little ſhame and confuſion. Do I require at my ſeruants hands any thing vnfitting, vnſeemly, or impoſſible? I require purity, which is a principall vertue: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him, that he ſuffer not himſelfe to be ſuppla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted or ouercome by his ſenſuality,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:15101:122"/>
and this is honorable. I exact of him, that which he hath promiſed, and that is to liue chaſtly, which is a point of iuſtice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Further, I long to know, wherein conſiſteth to leaue and forſake the world? Not that a man giue ouer to liue vnder hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or to dwell on earth, or to draw this ayre (for all theſe be neceſſary, and as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to ſecular men, as to Religious) but that he lead a life far different from that of the world. Amongſt the euills of this world one is, to neglect ſpirituall things, &amp; to ſeeke after the pleaſures, &amp; contentments of the fleſh. The Religious therfore, who forſake the world in ſincerity, muſt lead a life in conuerſation and manners contrary to the world, by mortification of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, by a renunciatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſenſes delights, and by a contemning of whatſoeuer this blind world loueth and imbraceth: and in brief, their conuerſation muſt be in heauen. But nothing ſo much contradicteth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of heauenly things, &amp; nothing is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall to the taſt of ſpirituall matters, as is incontinency: whiles on the contrary, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing promoteth a Religious man ſo to the leading of an heauenly life, as doth Chaſtity alone, which as it conſerueth the mind pure ſo doth it rayſe a Religious man to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:15101:123"/>
of heauenly thinges. The fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy life is off from that of the world, the more ſecure ſhall thy Chaſtity be, and vpon earth will ſooner further thee to the leading of a celeſtiall life.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Sonne, doeſt thou conceiue the cauſe why any vnchaſt man, euen amongſt the heathens, neuer came to ſo great impudency as he durſt publiquely in the preſence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers commit any laſciuious act, but rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded in himſelfe, would ſeek about for corners, and hidden places, wherby to hide and couer his fault. Naturall light hath taught him, that all acts of vncleanes be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the ſight of men, and therefore he ſeeketh corners, and hideth himſelfe, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt he ſhould attempt, or do any thing againſt his honour, and the rule of reaſon. Wherefore if an act repugnant to Chaſtity be vnworthy an heathen, how much more vnworthy a Chriſtian, in whoſe law the vice of concupiſcence is condemned. And much more vnworthy be they in a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, who hath profeſſed Chaſtity, and bound himſelfe by ſolemnity of Vow alſo to liue chaſtly. And though a man in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any foule act of carnality auoydeth to be ſeen of men, yet ſhall he not eſcape the ſight of God, who is euery where, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth

That one man ſubiecteth himſelfe for loue of me to another, his inferiour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon his will, and obeying him in all things, is both honorable, and very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, for that whatſoeuer is done for the loue of me, is done to me, and it is my part to remunerate &amp; reward it. But that a man placed in a high eſtate, ſhould to his owne great hurt and reproach ſubiect himſelfe to a vile thing, and inferiour to himſelfe, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to my will, who am Lord alſo of man. Go too now, tell me my Son, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be more conuenient, that a Religious man ſubiect himſelfe to the ſenſuall part, namely to the hand-mayd, or to permit, that reaſon, as the miſtreſſe commaund him. And if this be more conuenient, &amp; not that, it is more meete alſo, that a Religious man make an eſteeme of Chaſtity, by help wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he may bring the hand-mayd <hi>Concupiſcence</hi> in ſubiection to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> her lawful miſtreſſe.

                  <p>IN euery white and pure thing, the very leaſt ſtayne appeareth, and the whiter it is, the more plainly doth the ſpot diſcouer it ſelfe. Euen ſo in a Religious life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is moſt white &amp; pure, the very leaſt defect of purity is obiected to the eyes, and offendeth them that ſee it. Secular men haue Religious for certaine ſpectacles of vertues: but a looking-glaſſe diſpleaſeth, vnles it be all cleare and ſhining. In other vertues a light default neuer offendeth ſo much, or doth ſo great hurt in a Religious man, as doth a defect in Chaſtity. A Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man doth not eaſily incurre the loſſe of his good name, if either he tranſgreſſe ſomewhat againſt meeknes, becauſe he is by nature cholerike, or be not very franke and liberall, or ſeeketh after a little vayne glory, or be not perfectly humble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:15101:125"/>
For euery wiſe man iudgeth that a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, though he be neuer ſo hard, and faſt handed, may yet be an holy man. In like manner one by nature cholerike, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what curious, may yet be pious and deuout: but when they come to Chaſtity, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is conceyued, namely, that there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be any holines, where incontinency is, nor that the deuotion can be ſincere, where the perturbations of mind beare ſway: neither can there be ſpirit, where the fleſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth. Beſides, the defects of other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues be eaſily excuſed, either for that they grow of a naturall complexion, as choller, or for that they proceed of a good end and intention, as is ſparing and frugality: but a defect of carnall concupiſcence is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of all, and excuſed of none.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All thinke Religious men to be as it were the Salt of the Earth, and the Light of the World, as my Scripture ſpeaketh, and therfore they need to take paynes, that the true propertyes of ſalt and light may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in them.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:15101:125"/>
words, &amp; counſailes, he will eaſily conſerue others, but if he be vncleane &amp; ſtayned with a litle ſtayne of carnal deſires, he will by his bad example eaſily marre them. Light alſo ſerueth to giue light, and to ſhew where the dangers and downfalls be, but if the candles weeke be either foule, or moiſt, it yealdeth more of ſmoke then of light. So a Religious man, if he haue not a pure and cleane hart, will not only not enlighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo obſcure, and darken the way, that both himſelfe, &amp; all that do accompany him, may ſhamefully ſtumble, and ſo giue a greater ſtincke and ſmell, then light.

do thoſe Religious men ſinne, who do not beware of falling into the occaſions of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infamed by ſuch a vice, but perſwade themſelues, that it is inough, if they commit nothing that is euill by deed, whatſoeuer men ſay and report of them.

                  <p n="4">4. It is nothing conuenient to thruſt a man againſt reaſon out of his owne houſe, neither can it be done in conſcience. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, Sonne, that thy hart is my Temple and my houſe. I haue layd the foundations of it, raiſed and perfected the building, and whatſoeuer is faire and precious in it, hath come from me. And that this houſe might be euer beautifull, &amp; that I might ſtill make my aboad and habitation therein, I deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to the keeping of Chaſtity, a truſty &amp; vigilant keeper. But if thou wouldeſt now thruſt me againſt all reaſon out of it, thou canſt not do it without moſt grieuous ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge. And if thou haſt a will to driue Chaſtity out of the houſe of thy hart, that concupiſcence may commaund in it, thou

mayſt not do that alſo without a great cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. He that thruſteth out him, of whome he is holpen and honoured, will eaſily fall into the hands of ſome one, who will han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle him according to his deſertes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Tell me, I pray thee, when thou vowedſt perpetuall Chaſtity, what didſt thou promiſe to God? Didſt thou not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that thou wouldſt from thenceforth make warre againſt all carnal pleaſures both of body and mind? Didſt thou not promiſe to perſeuere chaſt to thy liues end? Doſt thou not therefore thinke, that thou art bound neceſſarily to performe thy promiſe, ſith thou canſt not look any more backe? Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou not, what my Apoſtle ſayth: Who ſhall violate, or defile Gods Temple, God will deſtroy him? And if thou for ſome litle carnall pleaſure driueſt me out of thy hart, with what right canſt thou challeng of me to be receiued into the kingdom of heauen? And if for a little pleaſure of the ſenſes, by defyling thy hart, thou abuſeſt Chaſtity, wherefore ſhouldſt thou exact her to bring thee to the viſion of God, promiſed to the cleane of hart alone? Vnderſtand therefore that it is no way good for thee in the very leaſt thing to offend againſt Chaſtity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt by Vow of Chaſtity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed

no way to preiudice her purity, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in great matters, nor in little.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is further neceſſary that a Religious man aſpire to the perfection of Chaſtity for this, for that he hath made a profeſſion of leading a ſpirituall life, which ſith it hath not a more ſworne enemy, then the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence of the fleſh, cannot poſſibly liue a ſpirital life, vnles the fleſh be firſt brought in ſubiection to the ſpirit. For the Religious who is truely ſpirituall, muſt not only be a ſtranger to the vice of the fleſh, but alſo be auerted from all thoſe, that haue their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen from the fleſh, or haue any dealing with it at all. And therfore he muſt diligently, &amp; carefully exclude and keep out all bad cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, &amp; impure ſuggeſtions. In his talke he muſt be circumſpect, that any words fall not from his mouth, that may ſeem againſt honeſty. He muſt not caſt his eyes vpon Iaſciuious acts, though they ſhould be done without ſinne. And theſe be helps for the mortification of the fleſh. But I would haue thee, Sonne, to conſider and obſerue, that the fleſh ſometyms faigneth it ſelfe dead, when it is not, &amp; pretendeth it ſelfe to be in moſt great ſubiection to the ſpirit.

When any tumult or ſtyr ariſeth in a common wealth, for the quietting thereof neceſſary it is, that he who firſt cauſed it, be forthwith laid hold on: for when the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and common ſort want their Captaine on whome to relye, they eftſoons diſperſe themſelues, and the tumult endeth. In a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man, who is like a Commonwealth well ordred, there is a tumult rayſed, when the inferiour part of the mind ſtirreth and rebelleth againſt the ſuperiour, and therfore for the appeaſing of the ſtirre, and bringing of the common wealth to quiet, it muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon the fleſh, which is the Captaine of the common people, and rayſeth vp the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions againſt the ſoule, and the deſires of the ſenſes againſt reaſon.

                  <p>SONNE, thou knoweſt well, that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity is a gemme of great price &amp; worth, no leſſe pleaſing to me, then profitable to thy ſelf. But thou muſt further know, there be many theeues and enemyes, who ſeeke to ſpoyle thee of it, or at leaſt to deſtroy and marre it, out of malice they beare vnto thee, &amp; therfore thou needeſt to be very vigilant, and well armed againſt their aſſaults. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt thou be ouer confident, though thy fleſh be tyed by Vow, ſith it is ſo crafty &amp; inſolent, that though it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not breake out by breaking the bands, which it euer labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to do, yet after her old manner, though ſhe be neuer ſo faſt bound, ſhe maketh ſtirres &amp; tumults, hoping therby either to worke her owne liberty, or to giue ſome deadly wound to Chaſtity her enemy. Neither be thou ſo confident, that Chaſtity, becauſe it hath for a tyme ſeated it ſelfe within the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of thy hart, is therfore ſecure, &amp; out of danger: for moſt ſtrong fortifications many times are ſurpriſed &amp; taken on a ſuddane, &amp; ouermuch ſecurity it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly hurtfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the mother of ſlouth, &amp; careleſnes.</p>

                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:15101:133"/>2. The firſt danger imminent is of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for ſeeing Chaſtity is round beſet with enemyes, born domeſticall and forayne, it may eaſily be betrayed, and therefore the religious muſt ſtand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his guard, that his domeſticall enemy, namely his fleſh, be not ſeconded, and backed by enemyes from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. Sonne, if thou wilt be intertayned delicately with meate and drinke, and ſleep at thy pleaſure, and yet thinke thou mayſt preſerue thy Chaſtity vnſtayned againſt the aſſaults of the fleſh, thou art greatly decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, becauſe by that thou effecteſt nothing but this, that thou giueſt weapons &amp; armes vnto the fleſh. And what meruaile, if it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter riſe againſt the ſpirit? What meruaile if it go about to breake the bands of Vow, and to thruſt Chaſtity out of her poſſeſſion, though ſhe hath long ſtayed therein? Wilt thou haue thy fleſh not to be wanton? Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtize it then with hard dyet. Wilt thou not haue Chaſtity betrayed, nor to be thruſt out of her houſe? Put a guard vpon her: faſting and watching be two good keepers, who do not only keep and defend her, but do alſo ſpoyle the enemyes of their weapons, that they may not riſe againſt her. The more thou flatter, and fauour thy fleſh, the more ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly it fortifieth it ſelfe againſt Chaſtity.</p>

                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:15101:134"/>3. Lord, for the ſuſtayning of life, and for the ſeruing of thy diuine maieſty, a man needeth meate, drinke, and ſleep, and if the fleſh waxe thereby proud, and riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſpirit, or Chaſtity, it is not our fault, becauſe it is not the end propoſed by vs. Sonne, I find no fault with thoſe things that be neceſſary for the intertayning of life, and the ſuſtayning of trauayles and labours for my ſake (for whatſoeuer is directed to my ſeruice and glory, is bleſſed, good, and laudable) but I only improue what is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. Meate and drinke not neceſſary, but immoderate, ſetteth the fleſhes concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence on fire, and bringeth the Chaſtity in daunger. Who eateth ouer much, ſerueth not me, but his owne appetite and deſire.

the hart, where Chaſtity reſideth, need a ſtrong guard, becauſe both good and euill make their entrance thereby into the hart. He that bath not a diligent and carefull eye to the keeping of the gate of his houſe, ſhall oftentymes find ſomething miſſing, &amp; taken away, or within it ſhall find ſomething that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he would not, and would wiſh away. For doores are made, that they may be ſhut and opened: they are ſhut againſt men vnknown and that may do hurt: they are opened to men knowne, &amp; to friends who may help. A Religious man muſt not permit any one to enter into his houſe of Chaſtity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining him firſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So do they in Frontiere places and townes of kingdomes, and there moſt of all where there is feare, or ſuſpition of treaſon from enemyes, where not only be examined thoſe that deſire to enter, but their packes alſo, letters, and weapons are viewed and ſearched that nothing hurtfull be brought into the Citty. And this vigilancy is not diſcommended, but commended. And yet this care and diligence oftentymes doth not remedy all inconueniences, ſith experience <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eacheth that, notwithſtanding the wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and warding at the gates, there be many treaſons committed. Wherefore then
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:15101:135"/>
ſhould not a Religious man ſtand vpon his guard in keeping the gates of his hart, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath all his good, and whereon depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth both his ſaluation, and his eternall damnation. Who will ſay, that the vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and diligence is ouermuch, where there be ſo many enemyes? Who keepeth the gates of his ſenſes negligently, ſhall find death entred into his houſe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Moreouer to conuerſe and keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with laſciuious perſons, or ſuch as be not chaſt, is to caſt ones ſelfe into a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt daunger of looſing his Chaſtity. For as experience hath taught, more chaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons haue been by the laſciuious drawn to intemperance, then haue laſciuious been by the chaſt induced to Chaſtity. For ſuch is the nature of the condition of man, as after the loſſe of his integrity of life, he is more prone to euill then to good, and as the ſick, rather deſiteth thoſe things that delight the taſt, then profit the health. But if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation with ſuch kind of men ariſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture of an inordinate affection, there is greater danger imminent. For if the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly company with vnchaſt perſons be daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, of how great daunger will it be to keep company with carnall affection? He that is prouoked by the obiect from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:15101:135"/>
and put forwards by an affection from within ſoon falleth, though he be ſpiritual. And therefore my ſeruants, who were in loue with Chaſtity, ſo ſoone as they percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued themſelues to be by any inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction drawn to daungerous company, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with left it, as an enemy to Chaſtity. For he eaſily learneth to halt, who often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeth, and keepeth company with the halting.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The ſame is the daunger of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of wanton bookes, which be repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Chaſtity. I know not, how that Religious man can be excuſed, who keepeth ſuch an infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within his chamber.

And if vnto ſecular men the reading of ſuch bookes cannot in good conſcience be permitted, how ſhould it be permitted to the Religious, that profeſſe Chaſtity? What is read in books, is reflected vpon in hart, &amp; what is ruminated in mind, is eaſily retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the affection.</p>

There is another enemy of Chaſtity the more to be feared, the more hardly he is knowne and diſcouered, and that is an ouer great ſecurity and confidence of a Religious man in his owne continency. For this hath drawn many into their ruine: and what maruell, ſith it is prides daughter. Who hath a will to be chaſt, and ſhuneth not the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, preſumeth ouermuch of himſelfe. My lowly and chaſt ſeruants did not ſo, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of their owne forces, they ranne dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently from whatſoeuer might ſet the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res and appetites of the fleſh on fire. And though ſecurity maketh not a Religious man raſh, and ouer bold, yet it maketh him negligent and careleſſe, and both the one &amp; the other doth enda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger Chaſtity not a litle. Who truſteth ouermuch to himſelfe, eaſily expoſeth himſelfe to perills, and therefore is often beguiled, &amp; ſuſtayneth a greater loſſe then he would haue thought.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIX.</head>
                  <p>SONNE, in the battayles that are fought amongſt men, it profiteth ſometymes to come before the face of the enemy, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes to skirmiſh with him, for as much
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:15101:136"/>
as boldnes is wont to abate the enemyes courage, and to cauſe him to fly. But in this ſpirituall warre, where we are to fight with the fleſh, the victory is obtayned rather by flying from the enemy, then encountring him. For he, who ſeeketh to ſet vpon his enemy, putteth himſelf into very great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be ouercome, and ordinarily his loſſe is greater then is the gaine. Neither ought this to ſeeme ſtrang vnto thee, for that in the conflicts of this world, whiles an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault is made vpon the enemy, the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers courage is ſet the more on fire, and the enemyes harts begin to faint; but in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the contrary happeneth. For the more manfully thou ſhall reſiſt thy concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, the more it rageth, and the fire of it increaſeth; in ſo much as it either ſtriketh and woundeth, or pricketh, and therefore more wiſdome is ſhewed in flying from it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou art not wiſer then <hi>Salomon,</hi> who becauſe he flying not from the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, fell ſo ſhamefully, as he did. <hi>S. Iohn Baptist</hi> my precurſour, though he were ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in his mothers wombe, did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for the auoyding of all occaſions of ſinning, hide himſelfe being but a child in the deſert: and wilt thou, who neither art ſanctified, nor ſo vertuous, thruſt thy ſelf
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:15101:137"/>
into the middeſt of occaſions, &amp; make head againſt thyne enemy to fight with him? This is a manifeſt ſigne, that either thou haſt not got any knowledge of thy ſelfe, or thou makeſt little reckoning of Chaſtities gift.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another meanes is, moſt ſpeedily to repell &amp; ſhake off the foule ſuggeſtions that the Diuell preſenteth to the mind. For they be like little plants, which if they be not fortwith pulled vp out of the ſoules garden, do ſoone take roote, grow, &amp; bring forth thornes, that pricke the mind, and choake vp Chaſtity. A Religious man, who put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not away vncleane thoughts after he hath once perceiued them, doth declare his liking of them: and if they pleaſe him, how can he loue the purity of mind, that is ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſuch manner of thoughts? Againe if foule cogitations hurt; as ſoone as euer they put out their heads; how much more will they hurt, if they ſhall by delay gather more ſtrength? Little coales, though they lye but a little tyme vnder cloaths, do not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding both cauſe a bad ſmell, and burne the cloath. If the Religious would conſider, from how great incommodityes and troubles they ſhould free themſelues, if they ſhould in the very beginning ſhake of the foule cogitations of carnality, there is
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:15101:137"/>
none, who would ſuffer the little ones of Babylon to grow to any bignes within his hart, but would inſtantly daſh them againſt the rocke. Our cowardize, and daſtardy in putting away impure cogitations, maketh the Diuell diligent and bold in tempting vs againſt Chaſtity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It helpeth alſo to chaſtityes conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, to be otherwhiles blind, deafe, and mute. For if it be true, that it is not lawful to ſee, or heare what it is not lawfull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, what cauſe hath a Religious man, when he goeth abroad, to caſt his eyes vpon the countenances of all that he meeteth? Let him leaue that office to the Painters, who for the true expreſſing of mens coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, muſt needs haue their eyes fixed vpon them. A good and chaſt Religious man rather taketh vpon him to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plate the countenaunces, ſuch as they ſhall one day be after death, then as they be in life. For what profiteth it to behold thoſe things that be nothing good, but be rather impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of heauenly things? The leſſe thou ſhalt ſee, or heare of thinges of this world, the more ſecurely ſhalt thou enioy the comfort of Chaſtity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another ſoueraigne help for the conſeruing of the minds purity, is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:15101:138"/>
of ydlenes, which as it is mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> comberſome to Chaſtity, ſo it is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting to the fleſh, which is accuſtomed to grow wanton by ydlenes, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently to become more fierce againſt Chaſtity euery day then other. To liue idly, is to ſet open the doore for theeues and robbers to enter into the houſe. For he, who careth not for the looſing of his own goods, doth nothing but giue vnto theeues oportunity of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing him of what he hath. Who is well buſyed, is not wont to lend his hearing to any one, but in neceſſary matters: but one that is ydle, and giuen to his recreations, is ready to heare all, whether the talke be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, or ſpirituall: if it be ſpirituall, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly paſſeth away, if it be ſecular and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, it taketh increaſe by ydlenes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Conſider thou now, whether it be conuenient that thou be idle, who art come to Religion for no other end, then to ſuffer many labours, and much paynes for Chriſt. And whether it be meet by ydlenes and eaſe to patronize the fleſh againſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, when as thou haſt by Vow promiſed thy Chaſtity to God? Some caſt the fault vpon the Diuell, that they be ouer ſore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with impure cogitations, who are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther culpable the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues.

                  <p n="7">7. My ſeruants, who now raigne hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily in heauen, for the mantayning of their Chaſtity on earth, exerciſed themſelues in two vertues aboue the reſt, to witt, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and pennance. Humility of hart, like a pious mother, ſeeketh moſt carefully to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue Chaſtity, as her deare daughter. For thoſe my ſeruants vnderſtood very well, that it was a very hard matter for a proud, and arrogant perſon to keep &amp; preſerue his flower of Chaſtity. Againe Pennance is the conſeruer of Chaſtity as touching the body, and therfore they were much giuen to the mortifying of their fleſh, ſome to faſtings, others to diſciplines, watchings, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afflictions of that kind, knowing that they were the preſeruatiue antidots of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And when theſe remedyes will not help,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:15101:139"/>
let them vſe more effectuall. Whence it is, that ſome for the extinguiſhing, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the heat of luſt did caſt themſelues into moſt freezing cold waters, ſome into ſnow, others caſt themſelues naked into nettles &amp; thornes, ſome did burne off their owne fingers. By which acts they declared themſelues to be great enemyes to their fleſh and faythfull conſeruers of their Chaſtity. The body cannot be brought vnder ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but by vſing ſome ſeuerity and rigour to it: and a body vntamed and vnruly can not away with Chaſtity, and in concluſion either cleane abandoneth it, or preſerueth it not long vnſtayned.</p>

                  <p>LORD, though I deſire much to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this courſe of life without falling and erring, yet I fall &amp; erre ſo often, as I am aſhamed of it. In ſomethinges I make ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much haſt, in others I am ouer ſlow, neither can I well reſolue, what I ſhould do. I doe further attempt many thinges, but yet with an vnfortunate euent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sonne, in this life none is ſufficient
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:15101:139"/>
of himſelfe, that he may liue as he ought, becauſe none hath euer come to that perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of knowledge, that he ſhould be free from all errour. Thou knoweſt not, what will be to morrow: the harts of men be to thee vnknown and inſcrutable, neither doſt thou well know thy ſelfe. How then canſt thou without falling or errour either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with others, or gouerne thy ſelfe? Who trauayleth by night and in darknes, though he fal not, yet he ſtumbleth at leaſt or goeth out of his way. And though thou mayſt be prouided of knowledg &amp; of light, yet where be thy forces, and helps neceſſary for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercoming of the difficultyes that often occur? For ſo violent be the perturbations of the mind, as they carry away euen thoſe who ſeeme to haue gone beyond the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans nature, neither be the forces of nature of ability to keep them in. And if in the naturall life, wherin the light of reaſon ſhineth to all, there be ſo many errors, how many will there be in the ſpirituall, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is both leſſe light &amp; vnderſtanding, and greater difficultyes do occurre?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So it is Lord, but ſhall we continue in this darknes, depriued of all helps and remedies? Sonne, in this neceſſity the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Obedience is able to giue thee both
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:15101:140"/>
an help and a remedy, of which it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying: Suffer thy ſelfe to be ruled. He that taketh a iourney, and cannot well ſee his way before him, ſtandeth in need of a guide, &amp; of one well ſighted, &amp; that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the way. The vertue of Obedience is that which deliuereth a Religious man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my hands, that I may guide and direct him. And ſeeing I am skillfull of the way, and know the windings, turnings, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultyes, let euery Religious man be ſecure and aſſured, that I will faithfully direct him in the way that ſhall bring him to life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, ſo he ſuffer himſelfe to be for his owne part gouerned, and brought to his iourneys end.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All Religious, whiles they renounce the world, begin to follow me, but many thinking themſelues not to ſtand in any need of my conduct, leaue and forſake me, not to any hurt of myne, but their own. It is not inough to haue begon. If there ſhould be no difficultyes, but in the entrance into the way, they might haue ſome cauſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing themſelues, but ſeeing the ſame to be dangerous all the way, and in the whole courſe of their iourney, they muſt not leaue their conductour. He, that not knowing the way contemneth a guide, manifeſteth
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:15101:140"/>
that he maketh little reckoning of his going aſtray.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the world I adminiſter, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne all: by me Kinges raigne, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces commaund: by me the Law-makers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what is iuſt, and the Iudges do iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And where I haue commaunded obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to be giuen to temporal Lords, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer reſiſteth their commaund, reſiſteth me, and my ordination. The ſame is done in the ſhip of Religion, wherein I am the chief Maiſter, and Pilot: I direct it, and bring it ſafe into the harbour: I aſſigne eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry martyner his office and charge, and to whome they and others muſt be obedient. And wheras I am in euery one of them, and determine what euery ſubiect is to do, to obey them is nothing els, then to obey me, and to contemne them, is to contemne me.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. All Religious be indeed in a ſhip, but all haue not good ſpeed and ſucceſſe in their nauigation. He that ſuffereth himſelfe to be gouerned, ſayleth on without danger, and hath not any cauſe to be troubled or afraid, and therfore, as the common ſaying is, goeth his iourney ſleeping. But he, who ſuffereth not himſelfe willingly to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned, ſtayeth not within the ſhip, one
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:15101:141"/>
while grieued that he entred into the ſhip, an otherwhile wiſhing to leape a ſhoare, and out of a diſcontent and puſill animity of mind he taketh no pleaſure of any thing at all. And whence cometh this? becauſe his deſire is, that the ſhip ſhould be directed, as himſelfe liketh beſt. And this is to haue a will to gouerne, and not to be gouerned. Woe to that Religion which accomodateth it ſelfe to the propenſion, and will of euery ſubiect. Who paſſeth in a ſhip from one place to another, muſt accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe therto, and not contrary wiſe. It were no good trauayling, neither would the ſhip euer get into the hauen, if the nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be directed as euery one liſted. That Religious man cannot liue in peace, who refuſeth to do the will &amp; commaund of another.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Doeſt thou long to know what Obedience is? It is nothing els, then a Burying. Wilt thou vnderſtand, wherein it conſiſteth to obey? It conſiſteth in the buryall of the owne will. O happy is that Religious perſon, who can truely ſay, and affirme: Now I haue buried myne owne will, and vnwillingnes: Now haue I ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed the liberty of myne owne will, becauſe he hath caſt off whatſoeuer might haue
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:15101:141"/>
hindred his entrance into heauen. None can take vp his croſſe and follow me, vnles he ſhall firſt haue buryed his owne will, and denyed himſelfe. A Religious man, retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his owne will, and doing as he liſt, is not dead to the world, and therfore apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth not to Religion, which is but one, and ought to be gouerned by one will, namely of the Superiour, and all the reſt of the wills of the ſubiects muſt be buryed: if they be not, as a body, that lyeth vnburyed, they will yield forth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable bad ſent.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Tell me, I pray thee, my Sonne, if a man ſhould without any cauſe, induced by his own will and pleaſure alone, take vp a body, that had beene ſome monethes ago buryed, would it not ſtrike an exceeding great horrour into all that ſhould ſee it, &amp; cauſe them to laugh at his folly, &amp; madnes? And what other thing is it, not to obey the Conſtitutions of the Order, or the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours commaund, then to take vp againe thyne owne will, and nill, that were before buryed, both which bodyes thou buriedſt at thy entring into Religion, with a firme purpoſe neuer to vnbury them, or to take them out of the ground againe? Thinkeſt thou to be excuſed before me, while, thou
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:15101:142"/>
now calleſt them, I can, and I cannot? That I cannot, which thou haſt ſayd to thy Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, thou didſt not ſay to me. I know, what euery one is able to do, or not able. I ſee alſo what a Religious man hath in his mouth, and what he carryeth in his hart. And I know againe, when not to be able, is not to haue a will for the ſhunning of ſome inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity, or paynes taking. And though the Superiour accepteth of his ſubiects falſe excuſe, neither examineth, whether he be truely able to do the thing, or no, that is commaunded, yet he hath no cauſe to be therefore glad. For the whole matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not in that alone, it will at ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time be examined at my tribunal, wher the laſt ſentence ſhall be pronounced, that will admit no hope of any future appeale. For men in cenſuring and diſtinguiſhing the truth of the thing, may be deceiued, but God cannot, who hath a perfect knowledge of all things, both within, and without.</p>

The labours on earth, the ſweating in procuring bread to eate, the paynes of women trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with child, and all other miſeryes, wherewith man kind is afflicted, be the puniſhments and maledictions of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which becauſe it is the daughter of Pride, can yeald forth no other fruite, then it doth. Thou knoweſt alſo what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of the Obedience of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that not only himſelfe, and all his family, but al the nations of the world alſo be bleſſed in his ſeed, of which was to be borne one, who by his obedience ſhould ſet open the gates of heauen, that were by diſobedience ſhut vp before: in ſo much as it may be truly ſayd, that all celeſtiall gifts, and all graces &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues be the effects, and benedictions of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>

On the contrary nothing troubleth, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth the Superiour more, and cauſeth him more to groane vnder the weight of his gouernment &amp; office, then to haue ſubiects ſtubborne, ſlacke, &amp; hard to obey. An vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable beaſt doth not eaſily ſuffer burdens to be layd vpon his backe, and after they haue byn with much payne layd vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, he either throweth them downe, or carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them with ſo ill a will, as a great care muſt be vſed, leaſt he caſt them downe at
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:15101:144"/>
length. A Superiour, that hath hard, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſtubborne ſubiects, cannot be confident in them, and therfore if any thing though neuer ſo little, be to be commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, there needeth more circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then if a man were to deale with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly beaſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Hence it is, that where the ſubiect ſhould other wiſe reſpect, reuerence &amp; feare his Superiour, through the default of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bience the quite contrary is done, that is, the Superiour feareth the ſubiect, whome, leaſt he ſhould giue him an occaſion of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his order, with the offence &amp; ſcandall of others, he leaueth to his owne will, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commaunding him any thing, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing him. O miſery to be lamented! In the world he liued as he liſted, not at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others charge, but at his own: but in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion he hath a will to liue at his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and with my coſt, and my bloud, which as it cannot be done without iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſo neither can it go vnpuniſhed. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould I not hate diſobedience, which is ſo iniurious to Religion? Why ſhould not the diſobedient diſpleaſe me, who be the ruine of their Religion? This is not the ſtate of the obedient. For the Superiour liueth with the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſecurely, without diſtruſt,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:15101:144"/>
without ceremonyes, he is confident in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and if he commaund the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any thing, though very hard, they moſt readily do it. He obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth without difficulty, who imbraceth all commaunds without any excuſe: but he, who forced, yealdeth to the Superiours co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundment, either doth it not at all, or doth it ill. He indeed retayneth the rynd, that is, the externall act of his labour, but he looſeth the kernell, that is, the fruit of the merit of obedience.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Moreouer I adde, that Religious Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience pleaſeth me alſo for this, that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth many other vertues in it ſelfe, and exerciſeth their actions. For when the Religious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for obedience ſake ſubiecteth himſelfe to others his equalls, or inferiours, he exerciſeth the vertue of Humility. If the Superiours commaundement that he doth be hard, he exerciſeth the vertue of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, becauſe he ouercometh the difficulty. If it be repugnant to the ſenſe, or to his owne nature, he exerciſeth Patience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe be exerciſeth what he is auerted from. If he obey for loue of me, he exerciſeth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: &amp; ſo Obedience maketh the Religious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like vnto me, becauſe my obedience had the company of theſe vertues. And ſeeing ſimilitude is the cauſe of loue and beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:15101:145"/>
it manifeſtly followeth, that all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient perſons be moſt inwardly conioyned with me: and the more vertues go in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with odedience, the more doth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient merit.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Sonne, the gift is the more accepted to him, to whom it is giuen: the more noble the thing is, in like manner it is the more pleaſing, when excluding all the vtility of the giuer, it is only an argument and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the giuers inward beneuolence &amp; good will. Wherefore ſeeing Obedience is the gift of a mans liberty, then which a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man hath nothing more noble, or more excellent; it cannot but be to me moſt deare, and ſo much the more, for that to the offering of this gift he was not moued vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any human reſpect, nor for the vanity of the world, but for the only loue of me. Though this alſo maketh the giuer acceptable to me, that for ſuch a gift beſtowed vpon me, he remayneth not poore or imperfect, for that the more a man giueth to God, the richer, and the perfecter he becometh.</p>

For them, that want the skill of ſwymming, it is good to reſt vpon others mens armes. A Religious man, who obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and permitteth himſelfe to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of another, ſwimmeth in his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours armes, and ſwimmeth ſecurely in the waues of ſpirituall daungers.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another vtility is, that Obedience freeth a religious man from an infinit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of moleſtations and troubles. Nothing tormenteth a man ſo much, as do the anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cogitations of mind, of which the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable man, who lyueth in the world, is meruaylouſly rent and gnawne, as is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:15101:152"/>
by her yong ones, which ſhe carrieth in her belly. And though he hath not care of family, or of the adminiſtration of the goods of Fortune, yet the very thinking vpon his owne affayres and actions is too comberſome. For he muſt not only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what is to be done, but alſo when, how, and by what meanes. And this loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and croſſe is againe increaſed by the ouermuch ſollicitude about the good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and ſucceſſe of the things that are to be done.</p>
                  <p>But all this is nothing, &amp; nothing worth, if it be compared with the cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſpirituall actions. For thoſe, that they may be pleaſing, muſt be conforme to my will, and if they be not done with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and diſcretion, I make no reckoning of them. And Obedience exempteth a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man from thoſe and all other cares, and cogitations, commending this one thing alone, that he obey, and lay all the reſt vpon his Superiours ſhoulders, whoſe charg it is to ſee, what, when, how, and by what wayes euery thing is to be done. It is in him to procure all things neceſſary both for the ſpirituall, and temporall: for he is the Father, the mother, maiſter, prouider, directour, guide, and all. What other thing
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:15101:153"/>
then is it to liue vnder obedience, then to caſt his burden vpon anothers backe? If you were entred into a wide wood, that almoſt had no way out, and dangerous for the cruell wild beaſts therein, and were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very ſore loaden, ſhould not he do you a ſingular pleaſure, who ſhould not only bring you ſafe out of the wood, but alſo eaſe you of your burden, by taking it vpon his owne ſhoulders? And what other thing is it to obey, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to trauayle the more ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a guide in the way, &amp; without any burden to beare? He that acknowledgeth not a benefit, neither regardeth, nor maketh reckoning whence it commeth, or who is the authour therof.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There is added another vtility of Obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that the things which be good of themſelues, it maketh more excellent; and what is of very little worth, it cauſeth to be had in greater eſteeme. He that moued by Gods grace, doth of a free will exerciſe a good worke, doth well, and meriteth a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward according to the greatnes of the work and his pious affection withall: but he that doth of Obedience exerciſe the ſame workes, out of the ſame diſpoſition of mind that the other did, meriteth much more by occaſion of the vertue, &amp; efficacy, which the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:15101:153"/>
vertue of Obedience addeth to that worke. And more then that, Obedience is ſo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and of ſuch power, as it maketh the works that are of neceſſity, more noble al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and thoſe that of themſelues are not praiſe worthy, as be the actions of eating, drinking, ſleeping, walking &amp;c. if the Religious do them by obedience, pleaſing vnto me, which I alſo reward according to the meaſure of the pious affection &amp; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they be done withall. And it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hapneth, that the Obedient without doing any worke, maketh more ſpirituall gaine, then he who doth the worke.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Religious, who hath a deſire to faſt for the puniſhing of his fleſh, for his ſinnes, and yet for Obedience ſake forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to faſt, meriteth more before God by not faſting, then doth another faſting of deuotion. For this man hath the only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his faſting: but that man hath merited not only the good of faſting, becauſe he was of his part ready to do it, but alſo the merit of Obedience. Iudge thou now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that be not a priuiledg, both profitable &amp; healthfull, which I haue conferred &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon the Religious, by the benefit of Obedience. And how am I affected, thinkeſt thou, vnto them, who are ſo little

deuoted to obedience? O what a detriment and loſſe ſuſtayneth that man in his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall goods, who doth all of his owne will that he might do by obedience. Euery good worke, great or little, if it be ſigned with the ſeale of Obedience, is of great eſteeme and price, as well in heauen, as in earth.</p>

Remember that I aſſumed, &amp; tooke vpon me the forme of a ſeruant, that I might ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect my ſelfe to men, and obey them for thy ſoules good. Neither did I propoſe alone, and openly profeſſe, that I was come not to do myne owne will, but the will of my Father who ſent me; but I began alſo very tymely to obey the precepts of his law, whereunto I was not yet bound, neither might I be drawn from the obſeruation of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either by ſhame or confuſion, or for any daunger of life.

                     <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote, I called Obedience, my Meate. And not without cauſe, ſith there was not any thing in this life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I tooke ſo great a pleaſure, as in doing of my heauenly Fathers will, in ſo much as whatſoeuer hapned bitter or ſower, became to me ſweet thereby. For this cauſe the Chalice of my paſſion, which was to my humanity moſt bitter, was moſt readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of my ſpirit, as a moſt ſweet cup, becauſe it was offered me with the band of Obedience by my Father. What Religious man then can with reaſon refuſe obedience which was meate to me? It is an ill ſigne when the Lords &amp; Maiſters meate cannot content the ſeruant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But what can it be, Sonne, that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thee not in Obedience?

vniuſt and wicked Iudges alſo, as <hi>Annas, Caiphas, Herode,</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> who though they knew me to be vniuſtly accuſed, nor that any thing of that which they wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obiected, could be proued againſt me, did neuertheleſſe condemne me to be crowned with thornes, to be whipped, and to the Croſſe it ſelfe; all which I tolerated with patience, without making of any appeale, or vſing any Apology for my ſelfe: &amp; more then that without ſpeaking any word at al. I alſo obeyed their peruerſe ſeruants, who did without cauſe buffet me, ſpit vpon my face, and moſt ignominiouſly dragged me vp and downe through the publike ſtreets. And of all this I complayned not, &amp; though I might haue reuenged my ſelfe, and might moſt iuſtly haue puniſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the moſt extreme iniury that was done vnto me, yet I did forbeare, and did readily do all that they commaunded me. Tell me now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be yet any hard and painefull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for thee to obey? Thou art not for Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience bound faſt to a piller, &amp; there whipt as I was.

Indeed the ſlowneſſe of the Religious proceedeth of the want of loue. If the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:15101:159"/>
were better affected to their Superiour they would alſo be more diligent in fullfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Obedience. In which kind the children of this world be more wiſe, and more ready, then the children of light.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another condition is, that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be intiere: for ſuch was my owne O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. It ſhall be inough for Religious men to loue this entierneſſe, if they throu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghly vnderſtand, that this is my will, and ſuch the Superiours intention, that what is commaunded be entierly done. There be thoſe, who be only ready to obey in matters of great moment, but not in little. To o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers it ſeemeth inough, if they do part of the things by the Superiour commaunded, and leaue the reſt vndone. I know not who hath made them Iudges, or Interpreters of Obedience. Neither do I know, whence they haue learned, that it is not neceſſary to obey to all that the Superiour decreeth or commaundeth.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Let them ſay, when they vowed Obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, whether they thought they were to obey in all things, or but in ſome? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they vnderſtood, that they were all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to obey, or only for a tyme? And if they vnderſtood, that they were to obey not in all thinges, but for a certaine tyme
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:15101:160"/>
only, who will accept of ſuch a vow? Surely I accepted not the vow of half, and mayned Obedience, but of that which is entiere and whole. If ſome ſeruant ſhould do but part of thoſe things that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded him by his maiſter. when he could haue done the whole, he ſhould not be kept long in the houſe, and though he were ſtill kept, yet in giuing vp his accompts it would ſoon appeare, whether one did owe any thing to the other, the ſeruant to the maiſter, or the maiſter to the ſeruant. He is not worthy of reward, but of puniſhment, who ſerueth not at the will of his maiſter. Many liue in Religion, with whome an accompt ſhall in the end be taken, and then it will be vnderſtood, whether they merit reward or puniſhment, who haue not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the whole and entier Obedience.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The third condition is, that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be done with Fortitude. The Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man pleaſeth me not, who manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth a fortitude of mind in obeying, when eaſy matters are commaunded, or obeyeth willingly whiles matters go well with him, &amp; the Superiour commaundeth thoſe things that be contenting vnto him. This is not true Fortitude, nor can a ſtout obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent perſon be well by this way tryed. Whiles
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:15101:160"/>
a faire gale of wind bloweth, euery ſhip ſayleth away merrily: and an infirme and weake man walketh in a plaine way. The Fortitude of an obedient perſon is found and diſcouered in painefull &amp; hard things, as when incommodityes, labours &amp; paynes be to be endured; when preſent afflictions of body keep him not from doing the acts of Obedience; when the courage getteth ſtrength in ouercoming of difficultyes.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. O how imprudently doeſt thou, my Sonne, whiles to the end nothing may be often commaunded thee, thou ſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſt thy ſelfe vntoward in performing Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, deceiued with this opinion, that he is wont to be ſurcharged with many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and offices, who manifeſteth his own promptitude, and facility in obeying. For what other thing is this, then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the Superiour of indiſcretion, and imprudency? Then to put away a moſt rich crowne from himſelfe? If I giue thee health and ſtrength of body for the taking of paynes, wherefore art thou ſo afraid of labours? Art thou ignorant, that the more thy paynes be increaſed, the more is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thy merit? Wherfore then ſuffereſt thou thy ſelfe to be ouercome of ſlouth &amp; lazines? This is not Fortitude, but malicious care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſnes.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:15101:161"/>
I did not ſo, who, when I could haue brought thee to thy ſaluation by eaſy meanes, did neuertheleſſe chooſe the moſt difficult and hard for thy greater good, as was death in the flower of my youth: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſe I any manner of death, but that which was moſt ignominious and bitter, before which there went ſo many and ſo great torments, not only contumelious and diſgracefull, but alſo cruell.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The fourth condition is Perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which if it be wanting, there is obtayned no Crowne at all, nor is there any merit of Obedience. I did runne the way of Obedience till death, contemning and remouing all difficultyes and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that encountred me on the way. My Apoſtles alſo perſeuered in the obſeruation of my precepts to the very end: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he who by his inconſtancy either for ſome commodity of his owne, or for other humane reſpect, neglecteth to performe Obedience, is not a diſciple of myne. To begin Obedience, and after without iuſt cauſe not to execute it, is a property of children, not of Religious perſons.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXVI.</head>
                  <p>SONNE, thy will is a blind faculty and power, and thou art further blinded by thyne owne paſſions, and ſo thou canſt not be a good guide thereto, leaſt both of you fall into the ditch. It muſt therfore needs rely vpon me, and vpon him who ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my place in gouerning. And this requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the ſecond degree of Obedience, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely, that thou not only ſubiect thyne own will to that of thy Superiour, &amp; conforme thyne vnto his, but that thou make his will thyne, which thou ſhalt effect, if thou im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print thy Superiours wil within thy ſoule. Two ſlips ſprouting out of this graffe, to witt, the Will, and the Nill of the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, are diligently to be conſerued, and if any other bud ſhould peraduenture begin to peep forth, it is preſently to be cut off, leaſt it take away the vigour and ſtrength from the yong graffe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Obedience, which appertayneth to this ſecond degree, requireth three proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, which make it pleaſing vnto me. One is, that it be voluntary; a ſecond, that it be
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:15101:162"/>
merry; the third, that it be feruent. Theſe three propertyes haue one common enemy which troubleth them very much, and is named Repugnancy. The Religious that ouercometh not this Repugnancy, is eaſily ouercome, beccauſe he knoweth not to obey cherefully and feruently: and if the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnancy proceed from the ſuperiour part, what is voluntary, is taken away alſo. But tell me, my Sonne, whence groweth the Repugnancy, that maketh thee ſo froward and backward in the performance of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? Is it peraduenture of this, that thou thinkeſt, by ſubiecting thy ſelfe to a Superiour, thou preiudiceſt thyne own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and honour? If thou be therefore ſory, and thy grief cauſeth a Repugnancy, thou haſt no occaſion of being grieued, but of being glad rather, ſeeing (as I ſaid els where) he who for loue of me ſubmitteth himſelfe to a Superiour, ſubmitteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to me, the Lord of all; and in this he doth not a little increaſe his owne eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and honour, becauſe he doth a matter worthy a generous &amp; magnanimous mind. And whiles he doth tread ſelfe loue, as it were vnder foot (which neither all, nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do) he plainly declareth, what a regard he hath of me, and of the loue of me. If I
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:15101:162"/>

                  <p n="3">3. Conſider Sonne, that this is to be a ſubiect: conſider that thou art come to Religion, not to commaund, but to obey. If thou wouldſt in thy Superiours voyce acknowledge myne, and if thou wouldeſt conſider, that to obey thy Superiour, is to obey me, thou wouldſt reioyce to haue any thing commaunded thee, and thou wouldſt obey both feruently, and moſt willingly. To thinke further, that in obeying thou forgoeſt thy liberty, is a notable errour, when as it is not only not loſt, but alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: for as much as by the benefit of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience it is conformed and conioyned to the diuine will, which is an infallible rule of working well, and therefore as long as mans will is conioyned with it, it cannot but worke well. Neither is it to be doubted but that, that liberty which relyeth vpon good, is more perfect then that which is otherwhiles accompanied with euil. That is not loſt, that is giuen to God, but it is made more ſecure, that it may not be loſt.</p>

Others had rather o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey one then another, as though I were not in all Superiours. But they plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer, that they obey not for loue of me. He that in Obedience giuen to Superiours regardeth me, maketh no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce between Superiors, but equally obeyeth all alike.

For he that obeyeth with a regreet. and vnwillingly, ordinarily murmureth, is angry, and giueth an offence to others; and in place of a reward that he might haue deſerued, if he had obeyed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, he doth voluntarily procure his owne puniſhment.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Sonne, haſt thou a deſire to be freed from theſe miſeryes? Stir vp in thy ſelfe an effectuall deſire of obeying me promptly &amp; ſincerely for the tyme to come, and craue this gift of him who is able to giue it thee. Next, exerciſe thy ſelfe manfully in al kind of Obedience, both great and little, and thinke, that he ſuſteyneth a great loſſe of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:15101:164"/>
ſpirituall gayne, who obeyeth with an ill will. He that is neere to death, and dyeth not willingly, maketh his paſſage the more painefull: euen ſo he who doth Obedience but yet with a repugnancy of the will, is a more torment to himſelfe, and therefore better it is of neceſſity to make a vertue. He that is able to carry his croſſe vpon his ſhoulders, let him not trayle it vpon the ground.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Some will indeed enter into the way of Obedience, but with this condition that they may go before their Superiour, not follow him. And theſe be they, who when they haue propoſed in their mind any exerciſe, or buſines to do, they ſeeke by ſundry wayes to draw the Superiour to their owne mind, and therein they be ſo anxious, and ſollicitous, as if they compaſſe not their owne deſire, they are much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. Neither doth their imperfection ſtay heere, but they further will do that exerciſe after their owne way, and not after the manner that is appointed by their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and ſo their will goeth before the wil of the Superiour. He walketh not in ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who carryeth his light behind him.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Superiour is he, who carryeth the light wherwith he muſt ſhew thee thy
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:15101:164"/>
way, not thou him, and therfore thou muſt follow him, and not go before him. Who draweth his Superiour to his owne man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing, ſeeketh not to obey his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, but that his Superiour obey him: and he that endeauoureth to draw his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to haue a will to that, which is in his owne will, doth preferre his owne will before his Superiours, &amp; therfore his fruits ſhall not be the fruits of Obedience, but of his owne will, which he taſteth of himſelf, and not I.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Another property of this ſecond degree is, that Obedience be merry and cheerfull, which ariſeth of the former. For he that obeyeth willingly, obeyeth alſo merrily: and he againe, who obeyeth with an ill will, obeyeth with heauines &amp; grief. A little Obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce done for loue of me with ioy, pleaſeth me more, then great Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence done with an heauynes. He that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not merrily, declareth that he loueth me not, becauſe ſad Obedience diſpleaſeth me. Moreouer he increaſeth his owne bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, euen as he who obeyth merrily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his burden of Obedience the lighter. O in how great an errour is he, who accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtometh himſelfe to a ſad, and delaying O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, becauſe he ſatisfyeth neither me,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:15101:165"/>
nor his Superiour, nor his owne conſcience; and within a while there creepeth vpon ſuch an one, a loathing and diſguſt of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſcipline, and after loathing there followeth a moſt vnhappy life. For he is miſerable &amp; vnhappy, who is not content with his owne eſtate.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The third property is, that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be feruent. Feruour ariſeth of loue, and if thou loue Obedience, nothing will be commaunded thee that thou mayſt not execute both with ioy and feruour. I know well inough, who ſerue and obey me fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently, and who coldly, and I know againe who they be, who can obey me with more feruour, then others. O if Religious men would conſider me preſent in all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and examine withall, how pleaſing it is to me, and what a pleaſure to ſee the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects manfully, cheerfully, and feruently to ſatisfy the precepts of their Superiours. If they would alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the bleſſings wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I preuent ſuch obedient perſons, no doubt but they would be moſt forward in performing the actions of Obedience.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Sonne, where is that feruour and heate, that thou hadſt in the beginning of thy conuerſion? Where is now that excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great loue that moued thee to deſire,

that many difficult and hard matters might be commaunded thee? Can it poſſibly be, that the greater knowledg thou haſt had of this very thing, the leſſe thou ſhouldſt do?

But whiles by reaſon he approueth that to be well done, whatſoeuer is ordayned by the Superiour, he putteth the will in a quiet ſtate. This coniunction and conformity of iudgments alſo profiteth to the perfect exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that which is commaunded.

                  <p n="2">2. Lord, I do not well conceiue, how the ſubiect may conforme his iudgment to his Superiours iudgment in all things, as he may conforme his will.

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:15101:166"/>
conuinced by ſome reaſon, that repreſenteth a thing as true, conſent vnto it, and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours vnderſtanding, conuinced by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther different reaſon, inclyne another way in the ſame thing, how can the ſubiect in this matter conforme his owne iudgment to the iudgment of his Superiour, when it is not in his power to reuoke his vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the truth formerly knowne?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sonne, what thou ſayſt, is true, when the truth is knowne; for then it ſo conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the vnderſtanding, as it cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, or inclined to the contrary. But when euidency and certainty is wanting, the vnderſtanding, holpen by the will, may rather be inclined to one part, then to the other, and then the Obedient, that he erre not, ought to ſubmit his iudgment to the iudgment of his Superiour, ſo as that he may not erre in will, he ſubmitteth it alſo to the Superiours will. Neither yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many ſubiects be of more ſharp witt, and of a more mature iudgment, then the Superiour is, be they therefore exempted from this ſubiection: for ſo long as they be members, they muſt be ſubiect to the head. But ſuppoſe, that thoſe ſubiects be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent for knowledge of learning, yet in matter and manner of gouernement, God
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:15101:167"/>
euer giueth greater light to the Superiour, then to the ſubiects, and therfore his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be preferred &amp; take place before the iudgments of others, and greatly to be reckoned of, ſith I vſe him in the gouerning and conſeruing of Religious.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But admit, that the Superiour hath not commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded ſomething aright, which yet is not accompanyed with ſinne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the ſubiect therefore erre therein, if he obey? In no caſe. Is he depriued of the merit of Obedience? Neither. Why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould he not ſubmit his iudgment in all thinges to the Superiour? When I was in ſubiection to my Mother, and to my foſter-father <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> I obeyed them both readily, euen in thoſe things, which I knew would fall out better, if they had beene done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. It is not for the ſubiect to procure that, that may be beſt which is commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Superiour, but only to attend to this, that he execute in the beſt manner whatſoeuer ſhall be commaunded, &amp; ſuffer the Superiour to appoint that which he himſelfe ſhall iudge and thinke to be beſt. Neither muſt the ſubiect forbeare the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of the Superiours commaundment, though he be certaine, that he ſhould do better if he did not. For the ſubiect is not
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:15101:167"/>
iudge, but only the putter of that in practiſe which is commaunded, ſo there be no ſin in doing it. This indeed is a defect of them who would that the Superiour ſhould or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne what were beſt, but yet they wil not do it, though the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues be otherwiſe bound thereto.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the Obedience of the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is moſt pleaſing vnto me, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of all queſtion, ſith it giueth the laſt perfection to the ſacrifice that the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offereth, whiles togeather with the will he offereth both his Vnderſtanding and his owne iudgment, which is the nobleſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of man. Moreouer it is knowne to all how vehement a propenſion nature it ſelfe hath put into man to the following of his owne iudgment, and yet a Religious man reſtrayneth this propenſion ſo far, as for loue of me he voluntarily ſubiecteth his own iudgment to another, which I eſteem highly of, and is very profitable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: for ſo he leadeth a quiet life, and moſt agreeable to a true Religious man: &amp; on the contrary, he that relyeth vpon his owne iudgment, is neuer at repoſe in any thing, and liueth vnquietly.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This third degree of Obedience hath three propertyes. The firſt is called
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:15101:168"/>
Simplicity, which conſidering me in the Superiour, cauſeth the Religious man to put his Ordinations in execution, without any examination, whether he ſhould allow them or not. O how diſpleaſing vnto me is the diſputing Obedience, which in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thing that is ordayned by the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, euer asketh wherfore, for what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for what end this or that is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? I haue not called thee out of the world to diſpute, or to examine thoſe things that be by the Superiour determined and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, but to do them. And that they be done, it is nothing neceſſary to know for what cauſe, how, &amp; for what end they be done. Wherefore let it be thy care to do ſo much of Obedience, as thou art bound vnto, and know thou, that it appertayneth not to the ſubiect to enquire, what end the Superiours haue propoſed vnto themſelues in their offices. If the Patriarke <hi>Abraham</hi> had demaunded of God, for what cauſe he would haue him ſacrifice his Sonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> vpon whome relyed the benedictions of Nations, &amp; many other promiſes formerly made, his Obedience had not beene ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, neither had he merited ſo much as he did by ſimply obeying.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The truly Obedient ſeeketh nothing,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:15101:168"/>
but to do the commaundment. O how greatly did I fauour thoſe Religious, who in the commaund of Superiours would not diſcuſſe and examine, whether they were profitable or otherwiſe, conuenient or not, or the contrary. Whence it hapned, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by their Superiour, they laid hand vpon moſt cruell &amp; fierce beaſts, as Lyons, leapt into riuers, watred dry ſtocks for a long ſpace togeather, and did many the like thinges, as ſtrang as theſe. And theſe left behind them on earth noble examples of Obedience, and for them they haue, for their ſimplicity in obeying, obtayned moſt glorious Crownes in Heauen. Sonne, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thou, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> God ſhould haue a particular care of protecting thee, as he had of thoſe holy Fathers? Obey then with ſimplicity.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The other property is Humility, without which neither Obedience, nor Chaſtity, nor Pouerty pleaſe me. For Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is Obediences mother, and the one may not conſiſt, and ſtand without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Proud will not ſubiect himſelfe to any, and therefore cannot be Obedient, Pride, becauſe it calleth the ſubiect backe from the execution of the Superiours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, both depriueth of all merit, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth the trouble.</p>

                  <p>SONNE, perfect Obedience requireth an abnegation of the owne iudgment, an entier reſignation of the will, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act execution and performance of what is commaunded. The true obedient regardeth not the perſon of him who commaundeth, and whome he obeyeth, but in him he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth his eye vpon God, for loue of whome he obeyth. The truly Obedient ceaſeth not to obey, though he knoweth that an errour is committed in the manner of commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: neither relenteth he in Obedience, though the Superiour be imprudent, or ſubiect to any other imperfection. He is deceyued, who obeyeth, that his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our may eſteeme much of him, or that he may obtaine ſomething at his hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is to obey for the loue of me.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The truly Obedient, at what tyme any thing is commaunded, runneth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, nor withdraweth himſelfe into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but rather offereth himſelfe readily to what is commaunded, or to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. The true Obedient regardeth not, whether it be from his chief Superiour
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:15101:169"/>
or from a ſubordinate, but he doth with a like promptitude imbrace the commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of both. He that had rather obey in one thing, then in another, deſerueth not the name of a truly Obedient man. He that more willingly obeyeth one Superiour, then another, is not perfectly Obedient. He that procureth that to be commaunded him which he deſireth, looſeth rather then gayneth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The truly Obedient ſearcheth not out, wherefore, or how this, or that is inioyned him, but it is inough to him to know, that it is commaunded. The tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Obedient, to make Obedience perfect, leaueth not his workes at halfes, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. He that obeyeth the Superiour for that he is wiſe, louing, kind, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, dexterous, or liberall, is deceiued, becauſe he is to obey him only, in that he is my Subſtitute, and holdeth my place. Reuerence is not exhibited to my Image and picture for the gold, or ſiluer whereof it is made, but becauſe it repreſenteth me: whence it is, that the like honour is done thereto, if it be made of paper, or wood, as there is when it is of ſiluer, or gold.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>ONNE, it is good to ſpeake of Humility, but better it is to exerciſe it by deeds. What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth it by ſpeaking, to deliuer many notable ſayings, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Humility, if in all that diſcourſe thou ſeeke after vayne glory, and fondly brag of thy ſelfe? The Humble, who thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth lowely of himſelfe, buſieth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:15101:171"/>
in his owne commendable matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather in remembring the praiſes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. He that ſeeketh to ſeeme Humble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; hunteth after the glory of men, groweth in pride, and the more humble he would ſeem, the more doth his prid increaſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. An humble man, as he acknowledgeth all his ſpirituall goods, &amp; gifts to prooceed from God, ſo doth he conceale them as much as he can, and locketh them vp with the key of modeſty in ſome ſecret place. He doth not only repute himſelfe in all his workes vnprofitable, but the more he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth, the more he thinketh himſelfe bound vnto me. For ſeeing he holdeth whatſoeuer good he doth, to be nothing worth, he attributeth all his good workes vnto me: yea he is aſhamed before me, that I diſdaine not to vſe his ſeruice, that is, ſo vile and contemptible an inſtrument, as he thinketh himſelfe to be.</p>

I haue reaſon to communicate my grace to the humble, becauſe they do for the loue of me renounce their owne honour, and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, ſo greatly eſteemed of in the world. I do vpon good cauſe beſtow a moſt noble Crowne vpon the humble in heauen, for that whiles they liued on earth, they tooke the crowne from their owne head, and layd it at my feet.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Before I came downe from heauen into the earth, I was moſt particularly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to Humility, &amp; therfore I choſe an humble Mother: &amp; I was no ſooner borne, then that I began to exerciſe Humility by deeds. For when as I was the Lord of glory, I became a ſeruant, &amp; ſubiected my ſelfe to men: and in proceſſe of tyme I did ſet vp a
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:15101:172"/>
ſchoole of Humility, and ſuch as reſorted vnto it, I informed by deeds &amp; by wordes to Humility vntill my dying day. In like manner my Diſciples made a profeſſion of Humility. And this is the cauſe, wherfore I had a perpetuall warre with Pride, for ſo much as I euer hated Pride, the capitall &amp; ſworne enemy to Humility, which I ſo tenderly loued. And ſith the matter ſtandeth thus, let euery one that is wiſe, iudge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be conuenient, that there ſhould in Religion, that is in my Family, any proud Religious man haue place, or that it were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that a proud ſcholer ſhould be admitted and receyued into the ſchoole of Humility. Hence it is, that ſome Religious do not go forwards in ſpirit, becauſe they be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the booke of Humility, which is the foundation of ſpirituall life, neither do ſtudy to imitate me, who am their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. It little profiteth the ſcholler to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the ſchooles, if he follow not his booke, nor exerciſe himſelfe in thoſe things that be taught in the ſchoole.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There be many amongſt the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, who of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues confeſſe, that they be ſinners, careleſſe, dull, ſlouthfull, and nothing at al: but if any other ſhould ſay ſo much of them, they are eftſoons troubled,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:15101:172"/>
moued, &amp; murmure for the matter, &amp; ſeeke to defend their own eſtimation &amp; honour: and theſe men are far from Humility. For a man in words to confeſſe himſelfe to be nothing, and yet in hart to hold himſelfe for ſomthing, is falſe and counterfait Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. And to haue a deſire to be eſteemed of others, is notable arrogancy. But the greater gifts an humble man hath, the more doth he abaſe himſelfe before others.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Deſireſt thou to know, my Sonne, what Humility worketh in a Religious man? Firſt it inclyneth his mind to thinke ſubmiſſiuely of himſelfe: ſecondly, when need is, it moueth him to manifeſt his own vtility &amp; baſenes, euen by outward action. He that is lowly in his talke, going, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, and other his actions, declareth himſelfe to be a contemner of himſelfe. Moreouer, true Humility cauſeth a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man to endure with patience and ioy to be contemned of others, &amp; cauſeth further that he be not only not troubled thereby or murmure, but alſo that he moſt hartily giue his Creatour thankes therefore, for as much as he knoweth, that by ſo doing he is the more likned to me his Lord &amp; maiſter. True Humility alſo inclineth to the ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of humane prayſes, and to the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:15101:173"/>
of all that is good, vnto God. Moreouer the Religious, who laboureth to the height of perfect Humility, muſt needs deſire, that he be contemned of all, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſh, that all may be througly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that himſelfe is truly worthy to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned of all.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Sonne, if in Religion thou art aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of an old, or patcht garment, or doeſt not with any willingnes exerciſe thy ſelfe in abiect offices, it is a ſigne, that thou doeſt not ſerue vnder Humilityes Colours, but art addicted to thy owne iudgment, and wiſheſt to be much eſteemed of others. If thou hold on this way, thou wilt ſoone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thy ſelfe. He that deuoyd of vertue, ſeeketh to be reckoned off, for that alone ſheweth himſelfe blame worthy. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man, who hunteth after credit and reputation with the world, liueth in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſtate. Moreouer thou loueſt Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or loueſt it not. If thou loueſt it not, thou ſhalt neuer be a cittizen of H aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. the gate whereof, becauſe it is narrow and ſtrait, receyueth not men proud minded. And if thou loueſt Humility truly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contemneſt thou an old garment, and to be contemned of others? What other thing is it to be contemned, then for a man
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:15101:173"/>
to exerciſe himſelf in Humility, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſe with it, &amp; by the benefit therof to make a ſpirituall gaine? If thou loueſt it, as thou beareſt me in hand to do, thou ſhouldſt be glad when any ſuch occaſion preſenteth it ſelfe. No merchant is diſcontented, when any occaſion offereth it ſelfe of traffique to his gayne.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Who art thou, which wouldeſt not be contemned? Art thou greater then I who am the ſonne of God? Thou art not: &amp; yet I was contemned of a moſt vile and baſe people, and moſt iniuriouſly handled by them. Art thou not borne in ſinne? Art thou not a ſacke of earth, full of infinit mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeryes? Wherefore then art thou moued and angry, if any one lay thy baſeneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thyne eyes, and who thou art, which thou ſhouldeſt confeſſe thy ſelfe? What doth it, wretch, auayle thee to haue left the world if in Religion thou continueſt to be proud? O blindnes! when thou wert in the darck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the world, thou thoughſt pride of life to be meer and damnable vanity, and thou conceyuedſt honour and eſtimation with men to be a childiſh thing: and now in the light of Religion thou apprehendeſt the ſame for thinges of great worth, and of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſight, when a man ſeeth better in darcknes, then in the cleare light.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Know thou for certaine, that he cannot be a good Religious man, who hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth after commendations from men. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any Religious man humble, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth not himſelfe contemptible, and wiſheth not to be ſo held and reputed of others. And this is ſo certayne, as if any thinke otherwiſe, he beguileth himſelfe: yea I ſay more, if it ſhould be for the good of peace, and for Gods glory, whether a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man were contemned, or prayſed and eſteemed, he ſhould conformably to the law of perfect Humility, wiſh conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt rather then honour, to be deemed rather a foole then wiſe, becauſe by that meanes he is made more like to me. And this Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty greatly pleaſeth me.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. All do not rightly examine the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of thinges, or make an vpright eſteem of them, and therfore my Prophet ſayd to good purpoſe: The children of men are liars in ballances.

For men

meaſure all thinges by the outward ſhew, but I caſt myne eyes vpon the inward, and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which lieth hid in the mind. And therfore many are of men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned as vile, and reiected as little profitable, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding be for many reſpects in my ſight to be preferred before others, and ſo their Humility do, as precious ſtones, ſhine beautifull in myne eyes.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The world onely eſteemeth the rich &amp; mighty, who hauing receiued their ſtipend of pride, are eftſoones puffed vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond themſelues, and do fill all things with their inſolencies, and loftynes of mind. And theſe, though diſturbers of peace, do meruailouſly pleaſe the world. But the humble and peaceable pleaſe me, whome I ſo much eſteem, that I haue a particuler care of them. And worthily, becauſe there is not a vertue of more regard with me, then is that of Humility: and more then that, no vertue is pleaſing to me, that is not foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Humility.

There be ſome Religious, who complaine that they find not that tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and peace of mind, which they had in their firſt entring into Religion: but if they ſearch out the cauſe, they will impute the fault to themſelues. The cauſe of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet is the defect and want of Humility. The humble hath peace with God, he hath peace with men, he hath peace with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and which is more commendable, he hath peace with his aduerſary. For none may without breach of peace deale with a proud perſon, but the humble.

True it is, Sonne, that man was created to a moſt excellent end, but we are to ſee &amp; conſider, by what meanes we muſt come therto: and therfore they who haue raiſed vp their throne too neere heauen, haue byn miſerably thrown down into hel. For as the Wiſeman ſayth: Who maketh of another mans houſe his owne, ſeeketh ruine. Wherfore if thou deſire to be rayſed to glory, whereunto thou art created, thou ſhalt not vſe any either more ſecure, or more commodious way and meanes for the attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therof, then if thou practiſe Humility This way held I, this way followed the Apoſtles, in this walked all the bleſſed in heauen.

Diuells. Other vertues take away particuler vices, that be the cauſe of ſome ſinnes only, but Humility taketh away Pride, which is the roote and head of all ſins. Humility cauſeth, that the humble are dearely beloued, &amp; acceptable to all. True it is that I make no great reckoning, when the Religious man doth humble himſelfe to thoſe who yeald him honour &amp; reſpect, for that is eaſy and done of all But I hold it for a great matter, if he alſo ſubmit himſelf to them, who afflict &amp; perſecute him. It is not a thing worthy of great prayſe, if a man humble himſelf to others in his aduerſityes, or whiles he is in great neceſſity &amp; diſtreſſe, but that he be humble whiles all matters ſucceed, and proſper well with him.</p>

How is it poſſible for thee to get Humility, if thou neuer, or ſeldome vſe the company of the Humble, when thou well knoweſt, that examples worke greater effects, then do words? How canſt thou be humble, if thou ſeldome humble thy ſelfe, ſith the habits of vertues cannot

Then lay before thyne eyes thy own defects, and buſy thy mind rather in examining thoſe things that be wanting vnto thee, then in thoſe that be in thee; for an humble perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealeth his own good to himſelfe. It hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth alſo often to call to remembrance, that thou art to dye. O how many haue there been more noble and more honorable then thou art, who be now nothing but duſt &amp; aſhes, which thou ſhalt alſo be ere long. It profiteth to contemne the dignity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the world, and to hold them for meere vanityes, as they be indeed. It is good for them who be in place of dignity, not to glory or be puffed vp, but to feare a fall, for that it is not ſo great a pleaſure to climb high, as it is dolefull, and hurtfull to fall downe againe.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Sonne, haſt thou a deſire to make an experiment of thyne owne Humility? Thou ſhalt know it thus. It is proper to the humble to ſhunne their owne prayſes, as it is a manifeſt ſigne of pride to ſeeke them.

The ſecond is of greater price, when he beareth the contemning of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with patience.

                  <p>SONNE, Charity is a fruit-bearing plant, which the deeper roote it taketh
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:15101:178"/>
in the Religious mans hart, the ſweeter fruite it bringeth forth. Two branches do ſpring therout; the one mounteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and imbraceth God, the other bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth downewards, &amp; imbraceth the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: it imbraceth thee with both for the ſauing of thy ſoule. For thou by louing God and thy neighbour, loueſt and gayneſt thy ſelfe, euen as by hating God and thy neighbour thou hateſt and vndoeſt thy ſelf: Of louing ones ſelfe much, there is a ſpecial commaundment, as there is of louing God and our neighbour: for he who loueth God &amp; his neighbour, loueth himſelfe. Of theſe two branches dependeth the whole Law, yea they be a ſhort ſummary of all that is written, eyther by the Prophets, or Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts. Charity is ſayd to be a celeſtial ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and that not without cauſe, becauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Theologicall vertues, that only mounteth vp to heauen, wheras other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues only enioy the fruits, but Charity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth both the fruit and tree togeather. Charity hath a different effect from Humi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> For this being founded in the knowledge of mans baſenes &amp; miſery, ſo far depreſſeth and humbleth a man, as it cauſeth him to eſteeme himſelfe for nothing at all: but charity relying vpon the maieſty of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:15101:179"/>
goodnes, raiſeth a man vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and maketh him to enter into the very boſome of his Creatour, the Ocean of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit goodnes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. My Scripture mentioneth many prayſes of Charity, thereby to induce all to loue it. One while it is called the Band of Perfection, becauſe it ſo ſtrongly bindeth mans will with me, as we become as it were one, for that is proper to loue, to transforme him who loueth, into the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, &amp; this is the greateſt perfection that a man can haue in this life. Another while it calleth it the life of fayth, the forme of all vertues, the prime fruit of the holy Ghoſt, and (to comprehend all the praiſes of it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather in a word) it ſayth, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is Charity, and he that is in Charity, is in God, and God in him. And what excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency is to be compared with God? What more ſecurity is there, then to be in God? and what greater pleaſure can a man haue, then to haue God with him. Charity wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth great matters in a man that is poſſeſſed of it, as contrarywiſe, when a man is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, he ſuſtaineth great detriments and hurts, and occaſion is giuen him of many and ſore falls. When the ſoule is by death ſeparated from the body, life inſtantly lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

a man, and all the beauty of the body <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Without Charity I acknowledge none for my friend, neither be any vertues pleaſing to me, if Charity hath not ordered them. If a man ſpeake the language of all nations, and ſhould haue the knowledge of all ſciences, and yet be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Charity, it doth him no good. And though he ſhould giue all that he hath to the poore, and yet ſhall not haue Charity, it profiteth nothing. And if a man ſhould deliuer his body ſo as it may burne, if Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be wanting, it is nothing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Go to, tell me thou, who in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion haſt no regard or eſteeme of Charity, what will it profit thee to haue renounced the world, and to haue left all that thou didſt poſſeſſe therein, to haue giuen ouer all pleaſures of the fleſh, and to liue in ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and command of another, if thou be without Charity? Doſt thou peraduenture thinke, that all this is ſaid of ſecular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not of Religious? Thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued: yea thy payne and puniſhment ſhal be ſo much the greater, ſith for this end I
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:15101:180"/>
haue called thee to religion, that diſrobed of the worlds cloathing, thou mightſt clad thy ſelfe all ouer with charity. But if thou now haſt ſo little regard to attend vpon my table in thy wedding garment, know thou, that to thine owne hurt, thou art one day to be thruſt down into vtter darknes for the ſame. If the fire that I brought down with me from heauen, be not conſerued in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, where will it be kept? If Religious be not amongſt the firſt who warme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with it, who will be? To ſtand neareſt to the fire, &amp; not to receyue the heate therof, is a bad ſigne. It doth not a little diſpleaſe me, to ſee a ſecular man ſet on fire with the loue of God, and a Religious man to freeze for cold. If a ſecular man exceed a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in ſtore of merits, becauſe he ſhall haue exerciſed more acts of Charity, it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth that a Religious man is worthy of great reprehenſion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sonne, thou haſt an obligation of louing me much, not in regard I haue made and framed the world for thee, or for that I haue giuen thee thy being, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou haſt in this life, or els for that I haue deliuered thee from the ſeruitude of the Diuell, and from the perills &amp; miſeryes of the world; but for that I haue tendred
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:15101:180"/>
thee with ſo great loue vntill this preſent houre. Loue is the firſt and greateſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of all, that hath beene conferred vpon thee. For that I made the world for thee &amp; thy ſake, proceeded from the fountaine of loue: that I ſuffred and dyed to ſaue thee, loue was the cauſe: that I drew thee out of the ſtormes and miſeryes of this world, loue alone effected it. And wilt thou not deeme it for a ſingular fauour, that I the Lord of glory, and King of maieſty, haue preuented thee, a poore worme of the earth, with my loue, without any one deſert of thyne? What neceſſity moued me, or what vtility and profit drew me to caſt my loue vpon thee? And therefore needs muſt thou be more hard then the flint, if by me preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſo louing a gift, thou loueſt me not againe.</p>

Lord, if I were to repay thee any thing, that by right ought firſt of all to be myne: for it is impoſſible, that I ſhould render thee any thing correſpondent to thy loue. When thou createdſt me, thou gaueſt me to my ſelfe: when thou redemedſt me, thou gaueſt thy ſelfe for me, and gaueſt me to my ſelfe againe.

Many loue their neighbour, but they know not how to loue, and therefore their loue is otherwhiles fruiteles, as alſo hurtfull. I gaue a commandment of louing thy Neighbour, and declared the manner of louing him. If thou loue thy Neighbour, becauſe he is thy kinſman, or friend, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is thy Countryman, thou doſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, this is not Charity tending to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but naturall loue, creeping vpon the earth, and common to Infidells, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians.

                     </gap> for our owne commodity, is not Charity but rather merchandize.</p>

Neighbour be loued, becauſe he is created to my likenes, and is capable of euerlaſting bliſſe. True Charity diſpoſeth, that our Neighbour be loued for God, and in God, and he that loueth after this manner, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all, the poore equally with the rich, the nobly borne, and the ignoble, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth all, and wiſheth them life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. He loueth them as well in tyme of aduerſity, as of proſperity: for he who cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to loue his Neighbour, in tyme of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, manifeſteth plainly, that he loueth him not for me. All this I vnderſtood, when I commaunded a man to loue his Neighbour as himſelfe, that is, that thou ſhouldſt wiſh vnto him, what thou wiſheſt to thy ſelfe. And as thou muſt loue thy ſelfe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n God, and for God by obeying his law on earth, that thou mayſt afterwards haue thy reward in heauen: ſo oughteſt thou to loue thy Neighbour, as capable of the ſame bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude with thee. O if the Religious would obſerue this manner of louing their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, there would not be ſeene ſo many partialityes in Religions and Churches.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some be loued moſt of all, becauſe they are learned, and kind, others becauſe they be rich, and in grace, others becauſe they are gentlemen, or of noble bloud, and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:15101:185"/>
thoſe that be not ſuch, they regard not. O fraud, &amp; deceit! What hath Charity co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon with learning and riches? as if a man that is not rich, or learned, or well apparelled were not to be loued? Charity hath in the firſt place an eye to me, and for that cauſe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all in me. But there is another miſery more to be pittied, that ſome do therefore loue others, becauſe they haue the ſame complexion of nature, and of bloud with them. This is not Charity, but a carnall affection, an enemy to true Charity. Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dilateth it ſelfe far more wide: for it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth it ſelfe to all, becauſe all be created to eternall glory, and all be ranſomed with my bloud.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sonne do not put thy ſelfe in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, both of hurting thee, and of offending me, and therfore regard not the complexion and inclination of bloud: if thou do, vnder the pretence of Charity, thou wilt foſter ſenſuality, which will ſoone deceiue thee, and will draw thee, and not thou it, into a place, out of which thou ſhalt not find meanes of getting out againe. Though the whole Euangelicall law be myne, becauſe I made it, yet did I particulerly name that; <hi>of louing the Neighbour,</hi> my commaundment, to giue thee to vnderſtand, how pleaſing to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:15101:185"/>
me was the ſincere loue of the Neighbour. I would alſo that Charity ſhould be the badge and cogniſance, whereby my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were to be knowne, in ſo much as ther ſhould not be any of my ſchoole, or of my ſheep, who loueth not his Neighbour, as himſelfe. Charity alſo is a ſigne of loue, that a man carryeth towards me.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thou art deceiued, my Sonne, if by not louing thy Neighbour, thou thinkeſt thou mayſt loue me. He that loueth not him whome he ſeeth (ſayd my beloued Diſciple) how ſhall he loue him, whome he ſeeth not? It is true indeed, that the loue towards God the creatour, muſt go in the firſt place, out of which the loue to the Neighbour may riſe; but it is true with all, that the loue of the Creatour is conſerued by the loue of the Neighbour, and therfore if this languiſh, that muſt needs faint with all. Many thinke they are my friends, and yet are not, for the malice and little good will they carry to their Neighbours. I am not a friend of an hard and peruerſe hart. Not to loue, is a ſigne of a fierce mind, but to hate is an argument of a wicked &amp; cruel hart. Loue if thou wilt be loued, and loue all, if thou deſire to haue me for thy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; for that if thou except but one from
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:15101:186"/>
thy Charity, thou ſhalt alſo thruſt me out of thy hart with him. If thou being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, wilt not loue one, becauſe he hath offended thee in ſome thing, what difference will there be betweene thee, and a ſecular man, who followeth the vanity of the world? My diſciples did not ſo, who neither hated, nor hurt, by the leaſt word thoſe who had iniured them, but were very glad, if they had at any tyme occaſion of ſuffering any thing for the glory of my name.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By what example canſt thou be more ſtirred vp to loue thy Neighbour, then by that of my heauenly Father, who notwithſtanding he had receyued moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and grieuous iniuries at the worlds hands, did neuertheles carry ſo tender affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards it, as he gaue his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſonne for it. And what did not I, being made Man, for my Neighbours, whiles I ſpent my whole life to do them good? Whiles I liued, I was their guide, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and I ſpared no trauayle or paynes at all, that I might ſhew them the right way to heauen. And more then that, I layd vpon myne owne ſhoulders all their debts, that were obnoxious to the diuine Iuſtice, for which dying vpon the Croſſe, I
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:15101:186"/>
ſatisfyed for all. Neither was there here an end of my ſingular loue to my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. For at what time I was to depart out of this life to my Father of heauen, I left my ſelf in the Sacrament of the Altar, both that I might be mans meate, and that I might vnite my ſelfe vnto him, and be euer with him: and alſo, that he being ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the vertue thereof, might one day mount vp on high, where he might fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer enioy thoſe heauenly goods wherto he was created.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. By this euery one may iudge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Religious, who be inuited to be perfect, as my father of heauen is, and who make profeſſion of imitating me their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ought by their very works to loue their Neighbours, and to help them in all they be able. Let it be conſidered and weighed, whether thoſe Religious be worthy of my loue, who take no care of louing their Neighbour, or els in regard of ſome very little incommodityes, which they feare, neglect to help them, who craue their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Let it be examined, whether the iniuries, hurts, and treſpaſſes done them be any fit cauſe of not louing, or not helping them, when as I ſuffered many far greater iniuries, and yet did not for that withdraw
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:15101:187"/>
my loue, but ſpent my life and bloud to do them good. All a Religious mans ſpiritual gayne (who cannot patiently put vp iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, and therefore will not do his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour good) is conuerted into his own hurt. For the iniury is domageable to him, who doth another hurt, and auaylable to him to whome it is done, if he beare it with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. If then the iniury giueth a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man occaſion of meriting, he hath in truth no cauſe to be greatly moued againſt him, who offereth the iniury. I neuer deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered ſuch kind of doctrine, I neuer gaue my ſelfe an example in that kind, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes taught, that good was to be rendred for euill.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Sonne, remember that thy ſelfe and all thy forefathers do take their beginning from one, that is from <hi>Adam,</hi> and for that cauſe be bound to loue one another, as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Call to memory my Apoſtle his wordes, when he ſayth: You are my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and therfore there ought to raigne that loue amongſt vs, that is amongſt the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one body. And by this thou mayſt manifeſtly vnderſtand, whether thou loueſt thy Neighbour truly or no. He that either little regardeth his Neighbour, or contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him, though in degree neuer ſo far
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:15101:187"/>
inferiour to himſelfe, hath not true Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Neither the head, nor the eyes, which be the more noble members of man, do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer contemne the feet, though they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour members, and leſſe noble. He that is ſory for his Neighbours good, or is glad of his hurt, ſheweth that he loueth him not, for that one member either ſuffereth, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth in company with another. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity deemeth the Neighbours either good, or ill, as proper to it ſelfe. He that out of enuy and malice either extenuateth, or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the actions of his Neighbour, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not me. It was neuer ſeene, that the hands would hurt the feet. He that aſſiſteth not his Neighbour, in what he is able, hath not Charity. The e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And more then that, I dyed, that I might deliuer thee from death euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and free thee from the cruell tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Diuell. See, Sonne, how deare a price I payed for thee. See, how by all right thou art not thyne owne, but myne. And know thou, that the benefit of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, though it be common to al men, is not yet communicated to all, neither do all enioy the fruites thereof, becauſe all haue not receiued the light of faith, by help wherof they may acknowledg &amp; know the way how to come vnto me.

He that ſeeth ſnares, and when he may auoyd them, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe raſhely into them, meriteth to be puniſhed: euen as he, who ſeeth not the ſnare, is worthy of compaſſion, if he be vpon the ſodaine caught therein.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I haue againe gone further with
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:15101:190"/>
others in beſtowing benefits vpon them, as with thoſe, whome I haue called to a more high and more perfect ſtate, and receyued into the number of my moſt deare friends, with whome I conuerſe far more familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then with others: &amp; theſe be the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; whoſe obligation is greater, then thou conceyueſt, ſith there is not a moment of their life, that receyueth not a new increaſe of one benefit or other.

All haue a will to fly from the Croſſe, but it hideth not it ſelfe from any, neither is there one only Croſſe in this life, but they are infinite. No place, no tyme, no ſtate is without aduerſityes, and therefore better it is to ſeeke a remedy againſt them, then to fly from them.

The only, and preſent remedy of all theſe calamityes is Patience, which preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not by flying away, but by reſiſting.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And for the vnderſtanding of the offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e of Patience, thou muſt know, that of the contrary accidents that befall men in the baniſhment of this life, there ariſeth in a mans mind ſo great an heauines and grief, as it obſcureth reaſon, and troubleth the mind. And as a feuer in the ſicke hindreth
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:15101:192"/>
the actions of the body, ſo doth ſorrow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe &amp; hinder not only the good actions of the mind, but further openeth the gate to many inordinate deſires and ſinnes. And for this cauſe it is written of the Wiſeman: Sorrow hath kill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> many, not only by a corporall death, but by a ſpirituall alſo. And Patience is a vertue, that tempering &amp; moderating the grief and heauynes, that is occaſioned by tribulations, conſerueth and armeth Reaſon that ſhe be not put from her ſtanding, and ouerthrown by the inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate deſires and paſſions of the mind. And this is nothing els, then to ſtop the entrance againſt many errors and defaults, that befall whils the mind is vnquiet, and the Reaſon troubled. And therfore in my Scripture it is ſayd, that Patience hath a perpetuall work, for that when the ſorrow, &amp; grief of mind is once moderated, all the hatred, indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reuenge, and other the euills which are wont to riſe of thoſe perturbations, are the more eaſily diuerted, and put by. And when the Reaſon is once free from all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, it hapneth, that a man execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the workes of vertue after an entiere &amp; perfect manner. Hence it is, that ſome call Patience the keeper and conſeruer of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and not without cauſe. For vertue
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:15101:193"/>
cannot exerciſe their power, when Reaſon is troubled, and the mind diſquieted, and therfore they need the help of Patience, that keepeth the reaſon free from perturbation, and the mind from diſquiet, &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the vertues be conſerued alſo. The houſe that hath not one within to keep it, is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoyled.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For to cure the deſeaſes of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, there be vſed three kinds of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dots. The firſt is that which the Phiſitians preſcribe, and this doth not alwayes cure or help, yea ſometymes it hurteth. For the Phiſitians often find not the cauſe of the ſicknes, and therfore they cannot well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply any cure vnto it. The ſecond is prayer, whereby recourſe is made to the heauenly Phiſitian, who as moſt wiſe, hath a perfect knowledg of all diſeaſes, and being omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, is of power to take them away in an inſtant. And this medicine, though it doth euer good, doth not for all that reſtore the health at all tymes. For the heauenly Phiſitian euer preſcribeth a remedy, that is expedient for the ſicke perſon, but corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall health is not euer good for the ſicke, &amp; therfore God doth not at all tymes giue it him. The third Antidote is Patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which alwayes cureth, being healthfull both to
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:15101:193"/>
body and ſoule, and helpeth not the ſicke alone, but the ſtanders by alſo for the good example that is giuen them. And this third Antidote is ſo proper to Religion, as the Religious, who either make little eſteeme therof, or vſe it not, be alwayes ſore ſicke. The ſicknes and infirmity is euill inough, when the mind is diſquieted by impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sonne, what is the cauſe, when any thing befalleth troubleſome vnto thee in Religion, when ſome great labour is to be vndertaken, or aduerſity to be borne, thou doeſt not vſe Patience, but art troubled, murmureſt, and afflicted? Haſt thou not giuen ouer the world to ſuffer aduerſityes for the loue of me? Haſt thou not reſolued with thy ſelfe to endure all thinges, though ſore and painefull, for the good of thy ſoule? Whence is it then, that when any occaſion offereth it ſelfe of accompliſhing thy ſo pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſires, thou reſiſteſt the ſame, and art troubled? Caſt thyne eye a while vpon me, and tell me, what ſinne I did commit in the world? Whom I offended all my life long? and yet from the tyme that I came into the world, I euer ſuffered ſomething, &amp; ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed downe many a bitter morſell for thy ſake. How many contumelies were forged
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:15101:194"/>
againſt me, how many iniuryes were done to me? which yet I endured patiently, to giue thee an example of liuing conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to thy vocation. And that thou haſt now a will to practiſe Patience in bearing reproaches with a contented mind, is a thing, that beſeemeth not a man of the world, much leſſe a Religious man, who hath made profeſſion of vertue, and of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating me, who did euer imbrace Patience in ſo affectuous a manner.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Lord, I would very willingly endure all thinges, for loue of thee: but when I ſee ſome to perſecute me vniuſtly &amp; wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, I cannot a way with it, and therefore am troubled and grieued. Thou art decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, Sonne, if thou thinkeſt, thou haſt any iuſt occaſion of being troubled. Tell me, was not I wrongfully perſecuted? Did not I put vp and diſgeſt falſe accuſations, and teſtimonyes againſt my ſelfe? Was I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore troubled? Or did I make my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint? And how many Religious be there already crowned in heauen, who ſuffered ſore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions whiles they liued on earth? If the bad and wicked ſhould not iniure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute any, the good ſhould not haue ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſtore of merits. To ſuffer wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, is the crowne of Patience. But if
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:15101:194"/>
thou ſuffer iuſtly, that is, for thyne owne ſinnes, it is rather a iuſt, puniſhment, then any vertue of Patience ſith Patience bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and putteth vp iniuryes for the loue of me. And therefore my Scripture pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them for bleſſed, that ſuffer perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but yet for Iuſtice. Iniury to him, who putteth it vp patiently, is a gaine, and to him, that doth it, a ſinne and loſſe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There be ſome Religious, that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh themſelues diuers wayes, ſome by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, others by wearing of haire-cloth, &amp; by diſciplining themſelues, which they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer both willingly &amp; patiently. But when the ſame are impoſed vpon them by Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, they fall to murmuring, &amp; are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and if they performe them, they do it againſt their wills, with a repugnance of mind, and ſo they looſe all their merit. And are they not manifeſtly, beſids the offence it ſelfe, deceiued herein? Tell me, I pray thee for what end thou ſhouldeſt puniſh thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſo cruelly, and with ſo great patience? Is it not to pleaſe me? If it be ſo, thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt with a greater readines, and more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience receiue and performe the pennance inioyned thee by thy Superiours, for then thou ſhouldſt do a worke far more pleaſing vnto me: for thou ſhouldeſt exerciſe three
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:15101:195"/>
moſt excellent vertues at once, namely, Humility, Patience, and Obedience. He that puniſheth himſelfe only out of his owne will, ſeldome becometh perfect.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. O how much do the men of this world confound the Religious, who are the children of light? For moſt of them car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away, either by ambition, couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or ſome other bad deſire, ſpare not to take any paynes, ſuffer moleſtations, and put themſelues into whatſoeuer perills for the ſatisfying of their vayne deſires: and ſhould not a Religious man patiently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſome tribulation for loue of me, and for the good of his owne ſoule? He that loueth not, is afraid to ſuffer. And more then this, the ambitious and couetous man if he ſuffer any incommodity at any tyme, is very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that grief and heauines oppreſſe him not, or diſcourage him in the continuing of his negotiation, that he hath begon, but with a ſtout courage ſeeketh diuers and ſundry wayes, and meanes, for the repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his loſſes againe. But ſome Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vpon the very leaſt croſſe, and trouble, ſuffer themſelues to be much diſquieted in mind, and are ſo ſore moued vpon the very leaſt word, as they looſe from thenceforth all the fruit of the reſt of their works. My
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:15101:195"/>
Apoſtles did not ſo, who went their wayes reioycing, that they were held worthy to ſuffer contumely for the glory of my name. And the Martyrs endured moſt cruell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with ſo great cheerfulnes of mind, as ſome, who were by Tyrants commaunded to go barefooted into the fire, did thinke themſelues in doing it, to walke vpon ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That a ſecular man ſuffereth iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes &amp; aduerſities with an impatient mind is nothing to be meruayled, ſith he thinketh himſelfe to be the maiſter of his owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and eſtimation, becauſe he did neuer renounce them, as do the Religious: and therfore no meruayle, though being iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he be moued. Againe, a ſecular man, becauſe he hath neuer put himſelfe vnder the commaund of a Superiour, thinketh himſelfe to be wholy his owne man, and to rely vpon himſelfe, and therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be much offenſiue vnto others, if he cannot with Patience put vp a diſgrace, or diſgeſt a contumely. But that a Religious man, who hath openly made profeſſion of renouncing all his owne honour and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, ſhould take the iniury, that were done him impatiently, is a thing vnworthy his eſtate.

                  <p>SONNE, learne of me, for that I am meeke &amp; humble of hart. Meeknes was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nger, it cauſeth that the mind exerciſeth vertue, without any difficulty. And whils it alſo defendeth the body againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nordinate paſſions, it maketh the body a fit inſtrument for the obeying of the ſoule in the purchaſing of vertues. And therfore the Religious, who taketh no great paynes in
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:15101:197"/>
attayning Meeknes, is not truly one of my Schoole, and more then that, ſtoppeth vp the entrance againſt vertue, and Religious perfection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is not any ſo vnciuill &amp; bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, who if he do but conſider the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, excellency, and propertyes of the vertue of Meeknes, would not extoll, and be in loue with it. Sonne, haſt thou a deſire to vnderſtand, how noble a vertue Meeknes is? Compare it with the contrary vice, namely with the intemperance of anger, which is bound to obey the reaſon of man, as to her Miſtreſſe whoſe handmayd ſhe is. For if it obey not reaſon, but go before it (as it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily hapneth) it ſo diſtracteth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultyes of the mind, and troubleth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered perſon, as he may ſeeme to differ no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from a foole and mad man, &amp; from a beaſt poſſeſſed by the Diuell.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Anger, when it once getteth poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and commaund of the mind, firſt of al it effecteth, that the angred perſon remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth neither God, nor his own conſcience. It depriueth the mind of all iudgment, that is, of the eye of the mind, whence blinded it is driuen into ſundry errours and falls. In the body it taketh away the equall temper and good proportion of humors, and giueth
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:15101:197"/>
cauſe to ſundry diſeaſes. Moreouer it hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth our Neighbours for the bad example. To be ſhort an angry mans life is moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, not only becauſe none willingly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>reateth with him, but alſo for that he will haue al things done after his owne manner, a thing that cannot be endured. Whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon when a thing is not done according to his mind, or he hath ſuſtayned hurt in ſome thing, or hath receiued ſome iniury, he eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoones breaketh forth into flat rayling and reuiling ſpeeches, threatneth reueng, and ſometymes alſo by his intemperance of mind turneth his fury and rage vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Meeknes remedieth all theſe euills, whoſe nature, and firſt office is to moderate and ſtay the intemperance of anger, and to reſtraine all other perturbations, ariſing of it. Firſt of all therefore it repreſſeth, and mittigateth the violence &amp; fury of anger: next it draweth the appetite of reueng to the rule of right reaſon, for as much as in the angry it is wont to tranſgreſſe and goe beyond the bounds of moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Meeknes in like manner conſerueth all the facultyes of the mind, euery one in his order, and cauſeth them to do their owne functions. Finally it reduceth the whole man to quiet
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:15101:198"/>
and maketh him fit, not only to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Creatour, but alſo to conuerſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Meeknes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Neither doth the force and efficacy of Meeknes ſtay heere, but it extendeth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſelfe further to the qualification and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of the anger of the Neighbours, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that one benigne and gentle anſwere, or one meeke action is inough to appeaſe the fury of any enraged beaſt, to ſay nothing of a man incenſed to anger. But (a thing much more to be regarded) Meeknes is of ſo great excellency and authority, as it mounteth vp to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, auerreth the anger of Gods iuſtice and obtayneth the pardon of moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinnes. Woe to him, who reſiſteth an angry man, more mighty then himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Moreouer the life of the Meeke is moſt happy, becauſe it is moſt acceptable not only to me his Lord, but alſo to all his Neighbours. Hence it is, that euery one willingly vſeth the company of the Meeke, and all deſire to gratify him. Conſider therefore, Sonne, how profitable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the vertue of Meeknes is, and conſider thou, whether it be not conuenient, that thou ſhouldeſt loue it, and labour with all
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:15101:198"/>
diligence to make thy ſelfe poſſeſſed of it. Neither let it ſeeme any painefull matter vnto thee to ſtriue againſt the inclination of nature, prone and propenſe to choller: for it is proper to a Religious man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine his paſſions, to mortify his ſenſes, &amp; to intertaine his inward peace of mind. But admit, that Meeknes had nothing of al this, yet this one thing ſhould moue thee to vſe all diligence for the obtayning of meeknes, for that it maketh a Religious man like vnto me, his Lord and Maiſter. Againe, is not all paine well taken in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing that vertue, that is no leſſe pleaſing to me, then it is profitable to the Religious himſelfe? Not for him to be Religious, but to be indewed with vertue, maketh him like to his Lord, and Maiſter. And for the leading of a quiet &amp; peaceable life, it is not inough to haue forſaken the world, but a man needeth further to bridle anger, and the paſſions therof.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Sonne, thinke not, becauſe thou art Religious, that thou art free from the darts of thine enemyes, becauſe the Diuell taketh more paines in ouerthrowing of one ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of myne, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of many ſecular perſons. The ſame enemyes alſo, that is, the paſſions and perturbations of the mind, when they
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:15101:199"/>
be not mortified, do giue the Religious ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſore woundes, and therefore they need a ſtrong and ſure buckler, for the receiuing of ſo many of the enemyes blows. And this ſhield is Meeknes, which no enemyes force can poſſibly breake, but goeth away with the victory by receiuing their blowes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It cauſeth the Meeke alſo in all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſityes and croſſes to place great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in me, and therefore while he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth with a ſtout &amp; vndaunted courage, he doth not eaſily giue way, nor in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity pleaſe himſelfe ouermuch: and this is, to hold the place of a ſhield not only in the tyme of warre, but of peace alſo. A Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get profiteth him, who holdeth it faſt, but he that eaſily ſuffereth it to be ſtroken out of his hands, is preſently wounded. And ſo is it with Meeknes, that defendeth him, who holdeth it faſt, and will not let it go.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Sonne, remember, that thou haſt bidden a farewell to the world, that thou mightſt rid thy ſelfe of the dangers of the ſna es of it, and conſecrate thy ſelfe wholy to a ſpirituall life, and to my ſeruice: but if thou be not Meeke, thou canſt obtayne neither. For if thou ſhalt in Religion be ſubiect to anger and wrath, thou wilt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily therein contend alſo with others, and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:15101:199"/>
ſo thou canſt not but be troubled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted. But if thou ſhalt be Meeke, thou wilt not haue contention with any, and with thy gentle and milde anſwers, thou ſhalt appeaſe thoſe, that haue a will to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Meeknes alſo helpeth, that thou mayſt be affected to ſpirituall and heauenly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which do then ſet a man on fire with the deſire of them, when they are well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and lookt into. But anger, when it troubleth the mind, leaueth no place for reaſon: but Meeknes, when it hath quieted the mind, thruſteth out darknes, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth light in place for the vnderſtanding of ſpirituall things, which being entred, the vnderſtanding preſenteth vnto the wil the imbracing of that, which it knoweth?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Amongſt the Euangelicall beatitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des I haue aſſigned the ſecond place next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Pouerty of ſpirit, to Meeknes, and for the reward I added the Land of the liuing, which is the heauenly countrey, where the Meeke ſhall inioy my preſence for all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: and as I was heere in this life their Maiſter, and an example of Meeknes, ſo wil I be their hire and reward in heauen. I ſhewed my ſelfe a meeke lambe for the loue of men, and a lambe is a figure of me, and therfore meet it is, that all thoſe, who haue

                  <p n="10">10. How it beſeemeth a Religious man to be Meeke and milde, and how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming it is for him to be angry, is no hard thing to be vnderſtood.

                  <p>SONNE, the kingdome of heauen ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth violence, and the violent only car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it away. If thou thinke, that heauen may be won by giuing thy ſelfe to idlenes and eaſe, by pampering thy body, and by yeilding vnto thy ſenſes their pleaſures in euery kind, thou art greatly deceiued. For this is not the ladder, whereby thou muſt mount vp to heauen, neither be theſe the armes, and weapons, wherwith thou muſt fight, and ouercome, but thou muſt offer violence to thy ſelfe, by mortif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:15101:201"/>
as often as it ſeeketh and deſireth after thoſe thinges, that haue no coherence, or corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the conſtitutions of thy religious Inſtitute. This is the way, that bringeth to heauen. And though thou mightſt come to heauen without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with thy fleſh going before, and without ſuffering of any tribulations, yet thou muſt neither deſire, nor wiſh it. For I the ſonne of God, did not aſcend into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, before I had ſuffered much, neither would I go thither, but by the way of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Religious man therefore, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue to win the kingdome of heauen, muſt needs take vpon him ſo much ſtrength, as he may ſeeme to fight for three: for he, that ſhall not fight for three, ſhall not go away with the victory. Firſt he muſt fight as a man: for ſeeing he ought to lead a life, correſpondent to his nature, that is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipant of reaſon, he is alſo bound to liue according to reaſon, which he cannot be able to do, vnleſſe he make warre againſt his ſenſes, which oftentymes reſiſt their maiſters reaſon, &amp; ſeeke to free themſelues from the gouernement therof. And Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is that, which ſubiecting the ſenſe to reaſon, cauſeth that a Religious man
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:15101:201"/>
contayne himſelfe, and liue within the bounds of vpright reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Secondly, he muſt fight, as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, by the ſword of Mortification, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off all that is forbidden by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian law. And therefore he muſt not only abſtaine from rapine, from killing of men, from fornication, &amp; the like, but alſo from a will of doing them, becauſe the one and the other is prohibited by my law. And herein thou muſt needs exerciſe a certaine violence, &amp; mortification. For ſeeing man in regard of concupiſcence and his depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued nature, is prone to the euill, by me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, if he take not into his hand the ſword of my law, and with it cut off, or put to flight, whatſoeuer is contrary or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the law, it will neither be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to triumph in heauen, nor on earth defend and maintaine the honour of a true Chriſtian. Thirdly, he muſt fight, as a Religious man, who as he is bound to many more thinges, then a Chriſtian ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man, ſo hath he more and greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultyes, and therfore muſt he the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtir himſelfe, and fortify himſelfe with the armes of Mortification, &amp; fight more man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with the enemy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That a Religious man may mortify
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:15101:202"/>
his ſenſes to liue conformably to reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is good, but for the auoyding of falling into ſinne, it is better to the accompliſhing of the precepts of my law. But if he further bindeth himſelfe to follow perfection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with obſeruation of the counſailes of pouerty, chaſtity, and obedience, it is beſt of all: for that ſo doing he doth not only abſtaine from all thinges vnlawfull, but for loue of me he alſo depriueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of many lawfull and good thinges, as of the dominion of temporall goods, of marriage, of the gouernement of himſelfe, and all that is his, and the like. Herehence it followeth, that a Religious man ought to be ſo mortified, as he muſt be ſeparated cleane from all creatures, yea and from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo, and muſt haue his dependance on me alone. And this is to beare away hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by mayne force. Sonne, he that conuerteth his eyes vpon the labours, and paynes that be in this combat, will thinke them to be many and great: but he that caſteth his eyes vp to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth, that they are not worthy of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture glory, that is there prepared for vs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Mortification is nothing els, then a ſpirituall death, that depriueth a Religious man of all the life of his ſenſes, and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:15101:202"/>
defirs, &amp; cutteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cleane off, with all the bad acts ariſing of the ſenſual life: euen as the death of body taketh away all the forces of the naturall life, and the actions therof. Wherefore that Religious man is truly mortifyed, who is dead to his owne loue. He that is dead to himſelfe, is dead to the deſires of the ſenſes, and leadeth a life conforme to the ſtate of his Religion, that maketh him Religious, and ſpiritual. The ſpirit may not continue life, if the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality be not firſt dead.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There be ſome Religious, who mortify themſelues in ſome one thing, and not in another. Mortification, if it be not whole, &amp; vniuerſall in all things, nothing pleaſeth me, becauſe there is no being, nor entrance for the ſpirit, where all ſenſuality is not taken away. The bird, that is tyed with many bands, is not free, &amp; at liberty, nor can fly her way, if there be but one thrid, that holdeth her faſt by the legge. One defect may hinder a Religious man from ariuing to the height of perfection. Neither do thoſe Religious leſſe diſpleaſe me, who begin indeed to mortify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but vpon the very leaſt inducement of the ſenſes, or terrified by their owne ſlouthfulnes, continue it not.

They thinke they pleaſe me, when they mortify their bodyes ouer much by faſtings, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines, wearing of haire, and watchings: but they are deceiued. For the good that is done with Diſcretion, hath the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of vertue, &amp; pleaſeth me: but what is done without Diſcretion, is a vice, and defectiue, and pleaſeth me nothing at all.

of their pride of indiſcretion. For if they would ſubmit themſelues to the iudgment of their Ghoſtly Fathers, or Superiours, that they might go the more ſecurely on in the way of ſpirit, they ſhould neuer preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues into theſe inconueniences.

And though they ſhould not tranſgreſſe in any thingels, then that in the way of ſpirit they would not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by them, whome I haue appointed to gouerne in my place, ſhould not this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ariſing of Pride, be a moſt dangerous vice and fault of the will?

I omit to ſay, that ſuch be often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes moued of vayne glory to do thoſe outward mortifications, that others may ſee them, though the ſame be moderate, more then to the inward, that are not ſeen to men, which yet are not hidden from myne eyes, and which I greatly eſteeme, becauſe the auſterity of life is not in ſo great a regard with me, as is the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vices of the mind.</p>

He that ſeeketh not to auert the miſchiefe and hurt, that is preiudiciall to himſelfe &amp; others, ſhall be puniſhed both for himſelfe and for others.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Lord, ſeeing our fleſh is one of our three capitall enemyes, and ſo troubleſome, as it moleſteth vs, both night and day, wherefore is it, that thou wilt not haue it afflicted and puniſhed? I haue heard it ſaid, that he who maketh ouermuch of his fleſh, doth nouriſh &amp; intertaine an enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his owne houſe, &amp; giueth him occaſion of raiſing warre againſt him. Were it not therefore a point of wiſdome, and better to make warre vpon it, then that it ſhould firſt of all aſſayle vs? Neither ſeemeth there any danger in puniſhing it ouermuch, or in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of exceſſe, ſith the Scripture ſayth, that none euer hated his owne fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Sonne, my Scripture alſo ſayth, that the ſeruice done to me, muſt be reaſonable
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:15101:208"/>
and diſcreet, that may not exceed or go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the appointed bounds. It is indeed my will, that the fleſh be mortified &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but yet with moderation. And though thy fleſh be an enemy vnto thee, yet thou muſt remember with all, that it is the ſoules inſtrument, and therefore it muſt be in ſuch ſort handled, as it may not rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her ſpirit, and yet may ſerue the ſoule in her owne functions. But if thou exceed in puniſhing it, it will languiſh, and pyne away, and ſo it will not be able not only not to ſerue thee, but it will ſtand in need of the ſeruice of others it ſelfe. He that is to walke well, muſt ſhun the extremes.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Some are openly tempted of the Diuel to multiply one ſinne vpon another, and they be thoſe, ouer whom he vſurpeth a full and abſolute commaund. Others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, becauſe they be not yet caught in his ſnares, vnder pretence of good he induceth to ſinne, as when he propoſeth vnto them, that it is good for a Religious man, if he bring his fleſh in ſubiection by long wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, and other aſperityes of body, as did the holy Fathers in the wildernes, who be now Saints in heauen, and are honoured in this militant Church for lights of the world. But the crafty enemy propoſeth
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:15101:208"/>
not, that thoſe actions ſhould be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſoule, or pleaſing to God, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by the rule of Diſcretion: neither doth he alſo declare, when the forces of men be not equall, that it is not conuenient for all to vſe the ſame ſeuerity towards themſelues: for what is mediocrity to one, is ouermuch to another. Neither doth he giue to vnderſtand, that there needeth the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell of ſpiritual Fathers, without which none may with ſecurity walke on in the way of ſpirit. Sonne, ſeeing the Diuell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth thee by himſelfe, if thou wilt not be deceiued by him in thy pennances and deuotions, follow not thine owne head, nor truſt thy ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Finally, that a Religious man may be diſcreet in all his actions, it is therefore alſo conuenient, becauſe he is regular, and reaſon requireth, that he direct all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to a certaine ſquare and rule, &amp; this is to be diſcreet. And more then all this, a Religious mans actions muſt be addreſſed to my glory: but what glory of myne can it be, if the ſame be vicious and indiſcreet? What pleaſeth me not, procureth not either honour, or glory. Conſider now, Sonne, if indiſcretion in faſting, diſciplines, and in other good workes of that kind diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:15101:209"/>
me ſo greatly, how much thinkeſt thou will it diſcontent me, if a Religious man be indiſcreet in eating and drinking, in ſleeping, and in the like actions, which be not of themſelues holy, but indifferent? How much ſhal he diſpleaſe me, if he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed &amp; be indiſcreet in actions that be bad in themſelues? If indiſcretion be ill of it ſelfe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioyned to a bad thing it wil doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les be worſe, and will diſpleaſe me more.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Diſcretion is neceſſary as well for Superiours, who gouerne others, as for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, who are gouerned. Diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is the child of beneuolence, teacheth them to be louing, and benigne Fathers, to be compaſſionate to their ſubiects, nor to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe heauyer burdens vpon them, then they are able to beare. And it teacheth the ſubiect to reuerence, honour, reſpect, &amp; obey their Superiours. O how diſpleaſing a thing is it to me to ſee a ſubiect indiſcreet towards his Superiour. Indiſcretion, becauſe it is crueltyes daughter, and hardnes ſiſter, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſubiect to afflict his Superiour, by ſhewing himſelfe froward in obeying, and diſſolute in diſcipline. I know very well, how many ſighes and deep groanes of the poore &amp; afflicted Superiours for their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects hardnes of hart, aſcend vp to heauen.
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:15101:209"/>
But woe to them, who ſhall haue giuen the occaſion. The contempt that is done to Superiours, is done to me, and it appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to me to examine and puniſh it.</p>

                  <p>SONNE, thou haſt many a tyme and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard, that Religion is the ſchoole of perfection, &amp; ſo it is: and therefore they that enter into Religion, be not perfect, but haue a deſire to labour to the perfection of Religious diſcipline. The ſcholler, that hath begon to follow his booke, hath no thing els propoſed to him, but to learne to ſpeake &amp; write Latin firſt, &amp; after to paſſe ouer to the higher Sciences. As touching the meanes, whereby he may come to his ſayd end, he ſayth not, I wil imprint theſe rules in my mind, I muſt be conuerſant in this booke, and read it ouer &amp; ouer, I muſt heare ſuch a leſſon: but he is indifferent, &amp; ſubmitteth himſelfe wholy to the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his maiſter, to read, or heare whatſoeuer ſhall to him ſeeme good. If a Religious man doth not the ſame in the ſchoole of Religion, he ſhall neuer write or read wel,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:15101:210"/>
but ſhall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit many errours in Religious diſcipline. His only care muſt now be to aſpire to perfection, but about the meanes proper to Religion, let him be indifferent, and leaue all to the iudgment of his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, whatſoeuer is in that kind to be don, And that Religious man is truly indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whoſe will, put as it were in to a payre of ſcals, weigh not more to one part, or thing, then to another, but is ready to do, what the Superiour commaundeth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Indifferency is Reſignations daughter, &amp; this cannot be without that. Therfore the Religious man, who is not, touching his owne perſon, and thoſe things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine vnto him, reſigned to my will, &amp; to that of his Superiours who ſupply my place, neither is, nor can be ſayd to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. O how little is that Religious in grace and fauour with me, who when any thing ſhall be by his Superiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him, anſwereth, that he is ready indeed to obey, yet he had rather do this, or that, &amp; if that be not yealded vnto him, he complaineth, or murmureth, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes alſo neglecteth to do what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him. This is no indifferency nor reſignation, but is a kind of contract. He that in accepting of obedience vſeth this
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:15101:210"/>
                     <hi>But,</hi> hath a meaning that his worke ſhould be but very ſlenderly rewarded. Who ſayth, I will do it, but I would, or will, declareth that he is not yet dead to himſelfe, nor hath renounced his owne will. In the world, when thou wert thyne owne maiſter, in dealing with me, didſt thou not ſay, I wil, or I would? and therefore thou haſt not yet either left the world, or it hath not left thee. This is no other thing, then to put one foot into two ſtirrops, and to haue a will to ſerue two maiſters. The world doth not leaue them, who do not firſt forſake it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Lord, if I be indifferent, and ready to performe all thinges that ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded me, who ſhall proue that to me to be better for my ſoule, and my quiet? Sonne if thou ſeeke to do that whereunto thyne owne affection ſwayeth thee, who may ſecure thee, that it is more expedient for thy ſoule, and for thy quiet? The good of ſoules proceedeth from me, and that I communicate to them who are conioyned with the Superiour, whom I haue aſſigned to gouerne: from whome, if thou, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art not indifferent, ſhalt ſeparate thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt depriue thy ſelfe of all the gifts and graces, which I am accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to beſtow vpon the ſubiectes, by
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:15101:211"/>
help of the Superiours. Beſides, if thou be a true child of obedience, thou oughtſt to iudge and thinke that to be beſt, that thy Superiour, where no ſinne is, ſhall ordaine: &amp; if thou be indifferent, thou art bound promptly to put it in execution. For if any errour hap to be committed, it ſhal neither be thyne, nor imputed vnto thee, neither ſhalt thou looſe any part of thy merit. A good Religious man examineth not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be better, or worſe that is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but it is inough to him, if it ſeeme bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Superiour.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Some there be, who can hardly be induced to make their habitation in that place, where Obedience would appoint them, or to do the buſines, that the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our iudgeth moſt conuenient for my glory, and therfore they are troubled, and cannot find any quiet or peace of mind, &amp; they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe this their diſquiet either to the place, wherein they dwell, or to the company with whom they conuerſe, or to the office that they execute, vntill they obtaine ſome change in them. But that euill is hardly cured, the cauſe wherof is not vnderſtood. This is no fit way of cure, and of remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: the origen of the euill is to be ſought into, which is an vnmortified paſſion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:15101:211"/>
of ſelfe loue. And of this it is, that a Religious man is not indifferent, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned in all thinges to the Superiours wil. Thinkeſt thou, the place will effect, that thyne inordinate paſſion, or proper loue may be remoued, and taken away? The change of bed doth not eaſe the ſicke man of his feuer, but doth oftentymes increaſe it. And though the change ſomewhat te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth the hoat burning of it for the tyme, yet within a while it torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth him more ſore. So hapneth it to a Religious man, who carryeth with him the cauſe of his vnquietnes, and that is his inordinate paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and vnles the axe of mortification be vſed to the cutting away of this bad roote, whatſoeuer change of place be made, it will euer be worſe with him: for the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the euill hangeth vpon him, the more ſtrength it getteth, and the leſſe indifferent it maketh him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But tell me, if after the change of place, or of office, thou find thy ſelfe as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, or more then before, as commonly it is wont, what wilt thou do? Wilt thou wiſh to remoue to another place? In no caſe: for that were to play the pilgrim without a ſtaffe, with thyn owne detriment, and the bad example of others. Or wouldſt thou
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:15101:212"/>
rather reſolue to mortify thy ſelfe there, &amp; to pull the cauſe of thy diſquiet vp by the roote? But that might be done as well in the place, to which obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce had ſent thee, and had beene done with edification of them, who knew thee to be vnquiet, little mortified, &amp; leſſe indifferent. He that hath not the ſpirit of God, though he ſhould find a place euen among Angels, will not ceaſe to be vnquiet.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Others againe are ſo tyed to one place, as when they vnderſtand that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour thinketh on ſome change, they are tempted, and much troubled: and which is worſe, becauſe they thinke themſelues in that place, where they then are, to abide with the fruit, &amp; increaſe of Gods honour and ſeruice, they cenſure their Superiours for imprudent, and deſtitute of zeale. Hence it is, that if they be againſt their will remoued, and ſent away to ſome other place, they do not well accommodate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to any function or office, but do trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble others, and liue very vnquietly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentedly themſelues. Can it poſſibly be, that ſo little a regard ſhould be had of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, which is a Religious mans crowne? When I called thee to Religion, did I then promiſe, and vndertake to
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:15101:212"/>
place thee there, where thou wouldſt, or where I would? Certes thou doſt manifeſt, that in ſeruing me thou relyeſt rather vpon thyne owne ſenſe, then my iudgment. O miſery! There is not a Religious man, that would not thinke, &amp; alſo affirme, that it is good, yea and neceſſary, that my ſeruants be indifferent and reſigned, but when he commeth to action, he findeth a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy. What auayleth it an Horſeman to haue a generous and goodly horſe, if he be not tractable? What helpeth it to haue a ſeruant, though he be neuer ſo excellent, if he ſuffer not himſelfe to be gouerned, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath a will to do my will.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Tell me, Sonne, is it not good for a Chriſtian to be indifferent in thinges, neither commanded, nor forbidden, and to be ready to do what I ſhall command him? as to haue children, or not haue any? to be of an healthfull body, or of a ſickly? Euen ſo, for ſeeing it is vnknowne vnto him, what is beſt for the good of his ſoule, there is good reaſon he ſhould ſtand to my iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this is to be indifferent. And if this be true, as it is moſt true, wherfore doſt thou, that art Religious, chooſe out of thyn owne will to execute this miniſtery and office rather then that, to dwel in this place
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:15101:213"/>
rather then in another? How knoweſt thou, whether this or that be more for thy ſoules good, quiet, or perfection? He that is not indifferent, maketh the gouernement the more hard, laborious and paynefull. He that is not indifferent, ſeldome yealdeth to the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Superiour, but ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily is inclined to performe thoſe miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, to the exerciſing wherof he is leſſe fit, ſith none is a good and impartiall iudge in his owne cauſe, in regard of an inordinate affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that deceiueth him. He that is not indifferent, peruerteth the order of right gouernement, for that, whiles he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modateth not himſelfe to his Superiour, as he ought, the Superiour is forced to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himſelfe vnto him. He that is not indifferent, can neyther be ſpirituall, nor deuout, and is ordinarily ſelfe-willd and heady.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X.</head>
                  <p>SONNE, Religious Modeſty is a ſilent Sermon, but ſuch as penetrateth, and is efficacious, which like vnto a ſharppointed arrow, entreth into a mans hart, woundeth it, and worketh wonders therin, and the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:15101:213"/>
more deepe wound it giueth, the more plenteous fruit it bringeth forth: &amp; it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth not only them, who heare the ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but him alſo who maketh it. For Modeſty intertayneth a Religious mans ſpirit, and maketh him ſo collected in mind, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to himſelfe, as all his actions breath forth a moſt ſweet ſent of deuotion, and is ſo excellent an ornament to a Religious man, as it maketh him amiable, and moſt deare to all who ſhall behold him. Againe inward Modeſty, whereof the outward proceedeth, is ſo pleaſing vnto me, as it is a pleaſure to me to vſe the company therof. And more then this, a Modeſt Religious perſon is of ſo great authority with others, as there is nothing, that he may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them vnto. And if they do ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges in regard of a Religious mans Modeſty, what is it conuenient for me to do, for whoſe loue he practiſed that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty? What ſhould he not obtaine at my handes, who is moſt deare vnto me, and moſt acceptable?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It produceth alſo wonderful effects in others. There is not any ſo incompoſed, ſo diſſolute, and diſordered, who would not at the very ſight of a modeſt Religious man preſently collect, and compoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:15101:214"/>
alſo to an externall Modeſty, thinking he ſhould tranſgreſſe the bounds of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, if before a modeſt Religious man he ſhould not demeane himſelfe with the like Modeſty alſo. Moreouer Modeſty woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the hart with a certaine other wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and that a more healthfull one, and this is: it ſweetly draweth others to deuotion, and to an imitation of good manners; neither giueth ouer, vntill it ſhall haue drawne them to a compoſition of the inward man, wherein conſiſteth the true quiet and peace of mind, then which nothing is more excellent, or more to be wiſhed in this life. For Modeſty produceth more plenteous fruit, and profit, preacheth more effectualy then doth the tongue. The Religious man is not blameleſſe, who ſhall not by his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty preach vnto others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Contrarywiſe the immodeſty of a Religious man woundeth the hart, but the wounding therof doth great hurt, both to him, in whome the immodeſty is, and to him, who obſerueth it. Who euer ſaw an immodeſt, &amp; wandring Religious man ſpirituall, and deuout? Immodeſty goeth euer accompanied with impudency, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and diſſolution of manners. And what ſpirit can there be of deuotion, where
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:15101:214"/>
there be found vices, ſo contrary to deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? The immodeſt not only wanteth all authority with others, but alſo is further a ſcorne to all: &amp; which is more, obſcureth, and (not to ſay) taketh away the fame and good name of his Religion, that had formerly beene won by the vertue and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of others. Moreouer the immodeſt not only offendeth &amp; ſcandalizeth others, but alſo inuiteth them to diſſolution, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the men of the world, who are eaſily induced to thinke that to be very lawfull for them to do, which they ſee done of Religious men. Now then conſider thou, what puniſhment that Religious man is worthy of, who when he was choſen out to be ſalt, &amp; the light of the world, for the conſeruing of ſecular men by his example, doth by his looſe manners put them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and ſet them on fire towards all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and impudency of life. An immodeſt Religious perſon is diſpleaſing to all wiſe, and ſpirituall men, who by his bad exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be ſo ſore offended, as they are confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for very ſhame thereat. And how can ſuch a man be pleaſing to me, who ſerueth me, and dwelleth in my houſe? It is the glory of a Prince of this world, if he haue a modeſt, ciuill, and well ordred family: and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:15101:215"/>
contrarywiſe it redoundeth to his ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſhame, if it be looſe in manners, &amp; giuen ouer to laſciuiouſnes. Euen ſo, if the Religious, who be of my family, be modeſt, it redoundeth to my honour &amp; glory: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe it is my reproach &amp; diſhonour, if they be immodeſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Lord, I haue euer heard, that thou art contented with a mans inward vertue, and with an vpright hart. And if that be true, it cannot be altogeather diſpleaſing vnto thee, if a Religious man be not at all tymes outwardly compoſed in manners, &amp; modeſt, ſo his mind be aright &amp; collected. Sonne, if thou thinkeſt me to be ſo deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the goodnes of the hart, as I regard not the outward conuerſation and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, thou art deceiued, becauſe I require both. Though the Religious, who is of a good, and vpright mind, be ordinarily compoſed alſo in externall manners, and contrarywiſe, who is not well compoſed within, is commonly alſo diſſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed without: In like manner a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man is bound to giue edification to his neighbour. If he be only compoſed in mind, he cannot giue edification, becauſe God alone is a beholder of the hart, and not the neighbour: and therfore neceſſary it is,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:15101:215"/>
that he edify with his outward modeſty, whereby a gheſſe &amp; coniecture is made of the inward modeſty, and compoſition of manners. If then the Religious mans out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward manners be not rightly compoſed, a man ſhall eaſily iudge, that the inward man is ill compoſed alſo, and ſo in place of edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication he ſhould giue offence, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There be ſome Religious men, who indeed make a ſhew of outward Modeſty, but are withall little ſollicitous about the mortifying of the deſires of the mind: but this is not the modeſty, that I requyre at a Religious mans hands. For if he deſireth to ſeeme humble and modeſt, that others may commend him for it, he taketh vpon him the Phariſaicall modeſty, which is ſold at a good rate to men, but for the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenes of the price, hath no reward at all in heauen. But if he would ſeeme modeſt, that he may edify, or at leaſt not ſcandalize his neighbour, he vſeth affected and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced modeſty, which hath not any long continuance. The modeſty contenting me, is that outward compoſition, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of manners, that groweth of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward compoſition, by benefit whereof all the deſires, and affections of the mind, be
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:15101:216"/>

                     <p>Of the Vertue of Prayer.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <head>CHAP. XI.</head>
                  <p>SONNE, moſt true is that, which ſome affirme, that Prayer is to me a ſacrifice, to the Diuell a ſcorge, and to him who prayeth a ſingular help. And that a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:15101:216"/>
may be offered vp for an odour of ſweetnes, neceſſary it is, that it be pleaſing not ſo much to him who offereth it, as to him vnto whome it is offered, and therfore that which may ſtir thee vp to the deſire of prayer, muſt be a pure deſire of pleaſing me, and not others, nor thy ſelfe. And doubtles, that prayer will be moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to me, if it anſwere my deſire, though thou ſhouldeſt not take any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thereof at all. The old ſacrifices were made, as I had appointed in my Law, and they that offered them, did not require of the miniſters any other thing, then that their ſacrifices might be done conformably to the diuine will. The Diuel doth not ſo, but he endeauoureth by diuers and ſundry wayes to hinder this pleaſing ſacrifice of Prayer. For one while he exaggerateth the difficulty therof, that thou mayſt giue it ouer: another tyme he pretendeth that the tyme is not commodious to do it, that thou maiſt put it of: now he feigneth that it would hurt thy health, that thou mayſt make light of it &amp;c. And no meruaile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as I ſayd, Prayer is his ſcorge, and therfore he is moſt of all afraid of it. And the more he hateth it, the more reckoning ought a Religious man to make therof, ſith
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:15101:217"/>
it is the ſpirituall food, wherwith his ſoule is refreſhed, and ſtrengthened.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The vertue of Prayer is ſo pleaſing to my Father of heauen, as he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me, to come downe from thence, to deliuer vnto my Diſciples a manner and forme of Prayer, wherein he would be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Father, that all might in their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſityes with a great confidence repaire vnto him, and both prayſe, and reuerence the diuine Goodnes in this holy exerciſe of Prayer, which is ſo pleaſing vnto him, as he ſometymes differeth to impart the grace that is required, and craued therein, that the Prayer may be repeated, and ſayd ouer againe. Prayer was alſo no leſſe pleaſing vnto me, then it was familiar vnto me, and therfore I recommended it in the Ghoſpell, and commended it vnto others, not by words only, but by examples and deeds. And when I had no leaſure to attend to Prayer by day, by occaſion of the paynes of my preaching, and of other works, done for the good of my Neighbours, I ſpent the night in it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. O how ſore that Religious man ſinneth, and how ſtrait an accompt is he to yeild vp one day vnto God, who eyther doth not beſtow the tyme, that is by his
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:15101:217"/>
Religion allowed him for prayer, in that holy exerciſe, or beſtoweth it not in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he ought, and might, if he would. And how great a ſhame is it to ſee, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſigne is giuen to ſome recreation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the body, they come running in all haſt, and diligence: and when the ſigne is giuen to Prayer, they come ſlowly vnto it? If thou doſt not performe, or very negligently performe the taske of thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prayers, doſt thou not conſider, that thou doſt it with the preiudice of other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious that haue a participation with thy Religion? He that maketh no conſcience to depriue his owne ſoule of the fruit of Prayer, will make leſſe conſcience to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud others. If the ſeruant be not affected to that, which pleaſeth his Lord, much leſſe will the Lord be affected to that which is pleaſing to the ſeruant.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Prayer is nothing els, then a talke, &amp; commerce of a reaſonable creature with his Creatour, to whome he confidently propoſeth both his owne neceſſityes, and thoſe of others, that as a Father of mercyes he would vouchſafe to aſſiſt, &amp; help his children. But thoſe pleaſe me much, who being to deale in prayer with their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father, do inuocate ſome one of the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:15101:218"/>
Saints, to whome they are deuoted, that they would pleaſe alſo to aſſiſt them with their prayers and petitions to God. They alſo pleaſe me, who do not begin to pray, vntill they ſhall haue craued grace of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well: as do thoſe alſo, who craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for their imperfections and ſinnes; for as much as this is, wont not a little to help and promote the fruite, and progreſſe of Prayer. They alſo do well, who to pray with fruit, do not only exclude the cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all other affayres, that are wont to diſtract the mind, but alſo ſeeke to be well compoſed, and to vſe ſuch a ſituation of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as helpeth towards the ſaying of their prayers both attentiuely, and deuoutly. For ſeeing Prayer is a ſacrifice to God, it is not lawful to pretermit any thing in it, for the beſt performing therof.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Some obtaine not at Gods hands what they haue craued in prayer, becauſe they craued not what was conuenient. He that asketh what is hurtful, or vnprofitable to the ſoule, asketh not that is conuenient for it, for as much as in prayer are to be cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thinges good, and profitable for the ſoule. Thinges indifferent, which may be vſed well or ill, ſuch as be honours, riches, health of body, muſt be asked with a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:15101:218"/>
if they be good for the ſoule. Better knoweth the Phiſitian, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſicke, what is more neceſſary for his health, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth neuer giue vnto the ſick what he demaundeth, but what may do him good. I did not take from my Apoſtle the ſting of the fleſh, though by his prayer he had more then once craued it of me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it profited him more to haue it ſtill. It is beſt for the Religious, if his ſoule be filled with merits, rather then that his will ſhould be ſatisfied. He that is not humble in his prayer, and acknowledgeth not his owne miſery, obtayneth not what he cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, becauſe he asketh not well. Who prayeth not with confidence, ſo as he fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely beleeue, that I am able to ſatisfy his petitions, obtayneth not grace, becauſe he prayeth not, as he ſhould. He that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth not in prayer, or giueth ouer his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition once begon, or els goeth forwards after a languiſhing &amp; cold manner therein, obtayneth nothing, becauſe he asketh not well.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There are ſome others, who ſo ſoon as they obtayne not the grace they craue, giue ouer their prayer to their owne loſſe, for as much as I had determined to beſtow greater graces vpon them, then they asked
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:15101:219"/>
of me, but becauſe they might not endure to be delayed, they loſt all. Whiles I differ the beſtowing of my grace, and they yet perſiſt and hold on in prayer, their deſire of praying waxeth hoater, and hauing obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, they imbrace it, and conſerue it with a greater feruour for the tyme to come. Moreouer they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue their prayer, which is a good action, &amp; meritorious, &amp; they make themſelues the more apt for the receiuing of the deſired grace. For whiles they are betwixt hope and feare of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the grace they craue, they examine themſelues, whether ſome ſecret ſinne, or imperfection of theirs may peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture be an impediment to the receiuing of ſuch grace; and if they find any ſuch, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come penitent for it, and therby they make themſelues the more apt for the receiuing of grace. Be not theſe diuers and different priuiledges of graces, that I giue, whiles I do not yeald vnto the petitions at the very firſt? Why then do they giue ouer their prayer? Many things are obtained of God by occaſion of a vehement and continued deſire of the thing, which if it ſhould not be, they ſhould not obtaine at all. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as my Scripture ſayth: <hi>Better is the end of Prayer, then is the beginning.</hi> For no worke is
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:15101:219"/>
finiſhed, being but begon, but when it is brought to an end. To one well diſpoſed God knoweth how, &amp; when to giue more then he is able to aske.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Others giue ouer their prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are dry, and find no deuotion in their prayer at all, but this is no good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for the matter. If that aridity grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth through thyne owne default, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou comeſt to prayer without any preparation going before, and with an head diſtracted with many impertinent cogitations, wherfore ſhouldſt thou giue ouer thy prayer for it? Let the cauſe of thy aridity &amp; diſtraction be rather remoued &amp; taken away. He that of his owne careleſnes ſtumbleth vpon a ſtone, doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cut off his own foot, becauſe he ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled without any his owne fault, neither omitteth he for that, to proſecute his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but is more vigilant, that he may ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble no more. Neither is prayer to be giuen ouer, when the aridity commeth vpon thee without any thy fault, for as much as I do ſometymes of purpoſe withdraw the grace of conſolation, that acknowledging thyne owne inſufficiency in thy ſelfe, thou mayſt for the obtaining of feeling, and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in prayer, humble thy ſelfe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe

For if thou doſt not profit by it, the fault is thine owne, and not of prayer. For thou mightſt, if thou wouldeſt, make moſt great profit thereof, ſith Prayer is a moſt profitable thing.

<pb n="401" facs="tcp:15101:222"/>
the troubles and trauayles, that be preſented in the exerciſe of vertues, is ſayd to perſeuere in good, and where conſtancy relenteth, there perſeuerance fayleth alſo. O how much is inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nſtancy in good works vnbeſeeming to a Religious man, who ſhould worthily be aſhamed, euen of the only thought of inconſtancy. And no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, ſith it is alſo diſhonorable to a man of the world, who yet maketh no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of practiſing vertue, if he once leaue off the good worke be had formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, ſith it is not good to begin a good worke, and to intermit it, and leaue it vnperfected without iuſt cauſe. And that Religious giueth it ouer to his greater ſhame, who leaueth his vocation though an inconſtancy, when as he is tyed vnto it by the law of vowes, when he made a profeſſion of vertue, and from the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of his firſt conuerſion, began to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to perfection. If a blind man, or one who knoweth not the way, ſhould go out of the ſame, he were worthy of excuſe: but if one illuminated, &amp; by long inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> intelligent of the ſpiritual way, as the Religious be, ſhould ſtray out of the right way, and by inconſtancy forſake his former ſtate, what excuſe can he pretend
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:15101:223"/>
for himſelfe? For it cannot be any iuſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, that he complaineth, that he cannot be at quiet in Religion, and in concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is afraid of the perdition of his ſoule: for as much as by this pretext he ſeeketh to couer and conceale his owne inconſtancy. But he laboureth in vaine, ſith he is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet for none other reaſon, then for that he hath a will to be vnquiet.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. O how much is this poore man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, thinking that he ſhould find more quiet in the world, then he hath in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as though in the world there were no troubles, &amp; croſſes, nor greiuous ſinnes committed, or that in the world there were more excellent remedyes and meanes for procuring of quiet, and of the ſoules good, then there be in Religion. It is nothing ſo, my ſonne: but theſe be meere fanſyes of thy, and owne ianglings and decyets of the enemy. He that aſpireth to quiet, and conſtancy in his vocation, which is as it were a certaine pledge of ſaluation, muſt be humble. An humble man, if any thing happen hard, or heauy vnto him, ſayth: This it is to be a Religious man, neither is he troubled, becauſe he thinketh himſelfe worthy to ſuffer more incommodityes, then he doth. Perſeuerance alſo dependeth
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:15101:223"/>
on patience, which is the elder ſiſter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Perſeuerance cannot ſtand. For if there be not patience in ſuffering aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, Perſeuerance eftſoones falleth to the ground, ſith it conſiſteth in enduring trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, paynes, trauells, &amp; miſeries vntill the liues end. Hence it is ſayd, that Perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance crowneth the works, becauſe it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth vnto them their laſt perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for that without it they ſhould be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For he is not happy who doth good, but he who perſeuereth in good, neither is a reward granted to him who worketh well, but to him who perſiſteth in doing good vntill the very end. Many begin wel, but all do not end well.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Some forbeare to perſeuere in the exerciſe of vertue, becauſe they are afrayd of the paine. For when they conſider that the payne is a ſore thing, and very hard, &amp; which they are ſcarce able to a way with, they caſt downe their burden, who when they might &amp; were of power to ouercome, are neuertheles ouercome, and ouerthrown by their inconſtancy. But Perſeuerance te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preth this feare, and animateth a man to perſiſt manfully in the exerciſe of good workes, as much as is requiſite. Sonne, if thou deſireſt to weare the crowne of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeu rance,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:15101:224"/>
thou muſt ſhun two extremes thereunto contrary. The one is called Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenes and eaſe, which eaſily yealdeth and turneth the backe for ſome difficultyes, that occure and preſent themſelues in the exerciſe of vertue. The other is a pertinacy, and will, that adhereth ouer much to it owne iudgment. But Perſeuerance, that keepeth the meane, neither permitteth the good worke once begon, to be hindred by any difficulty, nor to be put off, or differred longer, then reaſon requireth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Lord, I haue often heard, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance in good is thy worke and gift, and that it cannot be had, but by thy bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and that thou giueſt it where, and to whome it beſt pleaſeth thee. And if it be ſo, they ſeem free from all fault, as many as perſeuere not in a good worke begon, ſith they may for excuſe of themſelues ſay, that they haue not receiued the gift of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance. Sonne, it is true, that Perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in good workes is my gift, but yet thou art bound to haue a firme purpoſe of perſeuering in good, as in a thing neceſſary for thy ſoules health, and it is in thyne owne power to go againſt that purpoſe of thine, or alſo, with the help of my grace, to keep and continue it. Neither, though
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:15101:224"/>
the gift of Perſeuerance commeth from me, oughteſt thou therefore to be diſmaied: do thou thyne owne part manfully, and I wil diſcharge myne in aſſiſting thee with my grace, where need is.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Tell me now, my ſonne, what there is in Religion, that may make thee afraid of not perſeuering? Be they perhaps, the paynes, and troubles that be in Religion? or becauſe all neceſſaryes of body be not competently affoarded thee? But neither theſe, nor all things els can giue a Religious man iuſt cauſe of giuing ouer his good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I did my ſelfe from the firſt day of my comming into the world, till my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of it againe, ſuffer many and great incommodityes: and my labours and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſtill increaſed with my yeares. And if I moued out of my loue to thee, perſiſted in carrying my croſſe of paynes, and toyling till my death, why ſhouldſt not thou for the loue of me perſeuere in good, which by my ſpeciall inſpiration thou haſt choſen? Why ſhouldſt thou without cauſe abandon that, wherunto thou haſt voluntarily tyed thy ſelfe?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Conſider, ſonne, what ſentence is pronounced touching this: That ſaluation is promiſed not to the beginners, but
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:15101:225"/>
to the perſeuerant till death. Conſider alſo that it is already defined, that he is not apt for the Kingdom of heauen, who after his hand once put to the plow, looketh behind him. Conſider, that the Diuell entreth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with thy will, that he may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bring thee out with his owne. He pretendeth the yoke of Religion to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, that he may make thee to become an Apoſtata, and a fugitiue of his campe. It is not greiuous, that is endured for the loue of me: and though thou mighſt paſſe ouer this life without paynes, and croſſes, yet that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of life ſhould not content thee, becauſe I thy Lord did euer liue in trauails and carrying of my Croſſe.</p>

wouldeſt not raiſe ſo magnificall and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a building vpon ſo weake and frayle a foundation. That a man be highly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and held in great veneration, needs it muſt be, that there is an opinion, and eſtimation before in the mind, not of him who is to be honoured, but of them who are to giue the honour, touching his excellency and worthines. But if they ſee no vertue in thee at all, but imperfections rather, and leuityes, how can they haue a good opinion of thee, or ſpeake and report of thy prayſes? The good workes do cauſe a good opinion, and not the deſire of him, who ſeeketh his owne prayſes.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Deſireſt thou to ſee, how far thou art in this matter from the truth? Conſider what I am now to ſay vnto thee. Thou art either dead to the world, or not.

And amongſt the vanities of the world one is, to ſeeke after honour, and to deſire to be eſteemed for great. But if thou be dead to the world, why deſireſt thou to be honoured of it? A dead body careth

not, whether it be placed on the right hand, or on the left, in an honorable place, or whether cappes and knees be giuen it, or not. But if thou ſeekeſt for a more honorable place, or a greater office, if thou deſireſt that others ſhould giue thee place, how art thou dead to the world? Neither doth it ſatisfy me, if thou ſayſt, thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt honour, for my glory and honour, that thou mayſt haue greater authority with men, and by help thereof mayſt be able to do more good with others. For if it were ſo, that appertained to me, and not to thee to prouide; and if there ſhall be any need, I will not be wanting to my duty. In the meane time it is my honour, and my glory, if thou be humble, and not greiued, if thou be at any tyme contemned: for ſo thou ſhalt be like vnto me, thou ſhalt liue quiet in Religion, and ſhalt receiue thy reward in heauen. And know thou, that to be deſirous of prayſe, is not the way to help others, but to be a follower of Humility, Charity, and other vertues, and moſt of all if thou be wholy eſtranged from all ambition, and auarice, and giue good example to others.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                  <p>SONNE, to ſpeake faire to a friend, to pleaſe him, and to giue an occaſion of well doing, is very conuenient and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable: but to fawne vpon an enemy, who ſeeketh thine eternall ruine, and to giue him oportunity of ill doing, is very abſurd and deteſtable. Thou art not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that of three capitall enemyes thou haſt, one is thyne own body: thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt alſo, that thy fleſh, if it be not chaſttiſed and kept vnder, becometh ſo fierce and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, as it will cauſe thy ſoules ruine. Tel me, what law hath appointed, that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man ſhould fawne vpon his body, who is bound to reſtraine &amp; kurbe it with the bridle, and to mortify it? Wherefore ſhould the Religious attend to the care of the bodyes commodityes, who is aſſured, that the more he fauoureth and che ſheth it, the prouder it will become. My Apoſtle by chaſtiſing his body, and intreat ng it hardly, brought it to the duty it did owe to the ſpirit. He therefore, who yealdeth
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:15101:230"/>
vnto it ouer much, giueth an occaſion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it of reuolt, and of rebelling againſt the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Lord, thou haſt not made vs lords of our body, that we may take life from it, or mayme and mangle it, but thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs a charge to preſerue the health of it, as much as we can, and therefore we may procure thoſe commodityes therof, that make to the conſeruation of health, and ſo much the more, for that we vſe not onely the ſoule, but the body alſo for the doing of thee diuine honour, and ſeruice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sonne, it pleaſeth me much, that a Religious man conſerue and maintaine his good health by fitt meanes, for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my ſeruice, but this diſpleaſeth me, that vnder prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of preſeruing the health of body he maketh ouer much of it. I like not that Religious man, who will vſurpe and take vpon him a Phiſitians office, and iudge himſelfe what is for, and what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his health. For of this it happeneth that whatſoeuer pleaſeth his appetite, that is good for him, &amp; what agreeth not with his taſt, that is hurtfull for his health. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he offend me leſſe, becauſe he ſayth, he doth it for my greater and better ſeruice. And indeed it is not to ſerue me,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:15101:231"/>
but to ſerue his owne guſt, and ſenſuality. It is my ſeruice, when euery one mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his owne fleſh, as much as is requiſite, and it needeth. O how many Religious be there, who vnder a pretext of conſeruing their health, become the ſlaues of their own deſires? The health is better kept by parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and moderation, then by the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of thinges appertayning to the taſt. Yea by this the health is impayred, for that there is exceſſe in all thinges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly that haue pleaſure with them. Moreouer it is an obligation, proper to a Religious perſon, to yeald no more to the body, then what is needfull for intertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of life, &amp; not what is for the ſtirring vp of the fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the Religious man would exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whence ariſeth that ſo great a care he hath of himſelfe, and of his body, he would not be ſo anxious, and importune in ſeeking after the commodityes therof. In ſome it groweth of a ſuperfluous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration and pitty towards themſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could wiſh to yeald their body ſome pleaſure. In others it proceedeth of a magnificall opinion they conceiue of their owne eſtimation: for wheras they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that it greatly importeth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:15101:231"/>
wealth, if they liue long, their care is all in all about the preſeruation of their health. Both theſe, namely commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eſtimation, be ſelfe-loues daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And what good fruit can come of ſo dangerous a roote? Theſe men peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thinke, that if they were gone, my Church would come to decay, or their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion would come to ruine. They are greatly deceiued. Many other pillars haue fallen, and yet both my Church, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hold their owne: that care appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to me aſwell to conſerue both, as to prouide them of good workmen and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers. And I vnder take, that the Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when ſuch men are gon, ſhall not only not come to ruine, but ſhall further receaue an increaſe, becauſe thoſe commonly who haue taken leſſe paynes in Religion, and haue moſt troubled it, be thoſe who haue beene moſt of all giuen to their pleaſures, and commodityes of body. And theſe be they, who do by their example ouerthrow Religious houſes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When thou becameſt Religious, didſt thou it not with a mind of ſuffering much for the ſauing of thy ſoule, and for the loue o me? Didſt thou not purpoſe to liue a poore life, and to beare with all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodityes,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:15101:232"/>
that be incident to poore perſons? Whence then is it, that now, when thou ſhouldſt haue greater light of mind, and more charity, thou doſt not put thoſe thy firſt cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in effect by works? O extreme bad iugling and deceite. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is inſtituted for the mortifying of the body, and for the enriching of the ſoule with ſpirituall riches, and thou thinkeſt that a great care is to be vſed and had about the cheriſhing of the body with the neglect of the ſoules health? Tell me, I pray thee: In the world hadſt thou thy commodityes of body at will, or not? If not, wherefore deſireſt thou them in Religion, wherinto thou didſt enter to ſuffer incommodityes for Chriſts ſake? And if thou hadſt thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modityes, and didſt therof voluntarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue thy ſelfe for the loue of me, that thou mightſt pleaſe me the more, wherfore doſt thou now in Religion ſeeke them, by thee abandoned before, with an offence to me, and bad example to others? Moreouer, if thou haſt renounced the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modityes of thy body for the loue of me, and now returneſt vnto them againe, thou manifeſtly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that thou wilt not haue any thing to do with the loue of me. And what an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme ſhould I make of him, who is ſo fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:15101:232"/>
and inconſtant in louing me? And if peraduenture thou thinke, that thou mayſt both loue me, and ſeeke thy temporal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modityes withall, and that againſt my wil, thou art greatly deceiued: for as much as he cannot loue truly, who doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelfe to the will of the beloued.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Sonne, if thou deſireſt to vnderſtand, how I handled myne owne body, runne ouer my life from the day of my natiuity til my death, and thou ſhalt eaſily ſee, how few commodityes I vſed. For ſo ſoone as I came into the world, a ſtable was my bed-chamber, and the manger my bed. Within a while after <hi>Herod</hi> perſecuting me, I was forced to flye into <hi>Aegipt.</hi> Conſider thou heere, what commodityes I found both in my way thither, &amp; in a countrey ſo far off and barbarous, when as I had a poore Mother, who alſo was to take her iourney and to packe in all haſt away in the night tyme, ſo ſoone as ſhe had newes of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. After that being returned from <hi>Aegipt,</hi> I paſſed ouer the remainder of my life in pouerty. In the thirtith yeare of my age I retired my ſelfe into the deſert, where I puniſhed my poore body with hungar, thirſt, watching, lying vpon the ground, and the faſt of fourty dayes and nights.
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:15101:233"/>
After my leauing the deſert, I trauailed on foote from one towne &amp; caſtle to another, and preached the kingdome of heauen in all places where I came, and liued conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually by almes that others gaue me. In time of my paſſion, I did not only want all commodityes, but alſo one affliction ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in place of another. Finally, when I came to dy, a croſſe was my bed to lye on, and a crowne of thornes my pillow.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Now iudge thou, who art Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, whether it be conuenient for thee my ſeruant, who haſt made profeſſion of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating me, to handle thy body ſo nicely &amp; delicately, ſince I thy Lord haue dealt with myne owne ſo roughly and hardly. And though my body were euer ſubiect to the ſoule, and moſt obedient to reaſon, yet I did neuer entreate it delicately, nor euer yealded vnto it any commodityes, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations at al. And wilt thou now affoard vnto thy body, that hath ſo often in a moſt inſolent manner inſulted againſt the ſpirit and reaſon, all kinds of contentements and pleaſures? I the Lord of maieſty euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented my ſelfe with a poore and meane diet, and as meane cloathing, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaynement: and wilt thou in Religion, not contented with the common, affect &amp;
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:15101:233"/>
deſire ſuperfluityes? This is not to be, or to lead the lyfe of a Religious perſon, but rather to couer and conceale a ſecular life by the habit of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. An ouer great ſollicitude of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall commodityes, is a thorne that pricketh ouer ſore, and greatly hurteth a Religious man. For firſt it maketh him a procuratour for the body, yea and a bondſlaue vnto it. And who ſeeth not, how great an indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is for a Religious man of a puniſher of his body to become a Purueyour for it, and inſteed of whipping it, to yeald it all manner of contentements? Againe, it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and keepeth him ſo diſtracted in mind as he taketh no guſt, or pleaſure at all in matters of ſpirit. And what other thing is this, then to make him ſenſuall, that he may neither taſt, nor mind thoſe thinges that be of God? Moreouer it maketh him churliſh and harſh to thoſe with whome he liueth: for as much as he euer will in all things haue what is beſt, and moſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for himſelfe, neglecting the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dityes of others: yea he preferreth his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate commodityes before the common, not regarding what hurt may redound to the Religion thereby, ſo he may haue what he deſireth himſelfe. And what is this,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:15101:234"/>
but to ſpoile a Religious man of charity, diſcretion, and all?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Neither is there heer an end of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune &amp; prepoſterous care of the body, but it further maketh the Religious que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous, idle, froward, ſurly, a murmurer, and of a peruerſe and bad example. He would haue all moued to commiſerate and pitty his caſe, all to ſhew beneuolence &amp; good will vnto him, and therfore he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth euery leaſt diſtemper of body, and indiſpoſition of his health to the ſore tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes and paynes, he hath taken in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And how can it be poſſible, that there ſhould be either ſpirit, or Religious diſcipline in ſuch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?

                  <p n="2">2. It is true, that in holy Writ I haue promiſed to the Religious an hundred fold togeather with life euerlaſting, but yet to them who out of a loue of ſeruing me, haue left father and mother, and whatſoeuer they poſſeſſed in the world. True it is, that I am the maiſter, and do teach, &amp; haue alſo from the very beginning proteſted, that none can be my diſciple, who ſhall not hate father and mother, his owne life, &amp; what euer befids, that may keep him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> profiting in ſpirit. He is not a good ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, neither can profit, who is not attentiue to what is read in the ſchoole. The leſſon that I deliuer to my hearers is, that they dye to the world, that they maiſter &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due their perturbations of mind that make a man vnquiet, that they ſpoile themſelues of all carnall affection to parents, leaſt they be excluded and ſhut out of the way to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Doſt not thou by thyne owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience find, that the ouermuch affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou carryeſt to thy parents, maketh thee vnquiet? Seeſt thou not alſo, that the ſame moleſteth and troubleth others? Doſt thou
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:15101:239"/>
not obſerue, that whiles thy myne and care is on them, thou comeſt to forget thy ſelfe? And this in truth is not to reſort to my ſchoole, but to runne rather out of it. If thou be dead to the world, why doth the care of parents trouble thee? If thou only liueſt to me, as thou oughteſt, why art thou not conioyned with me, and holdeſt me in place of Father and mother, &amp; of all things els? O how well did my beloued, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſeruant S. <hi>Francis</hi> vnderſtand this, when he ſayd from his hart: <hi>Deus meus &amp; om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and other my Religious Saints, who to auoyd all occaſions of dealing with their parents, retyred themſelues into far remote deſerts, and as men dead to the world, hid themſelues in caues vnder ground, as in their ſepulchres and graues.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Lord, haſt thou not commaunded in thy holy Law, that our neighbours ſhould be loued, yea &amp; our enenyes to, &amp; that they are to be holpen in their neceſſityes, and wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.

and with that loue, which perfect Charity requireth. And thou art not ignorant, I know, that thou art more neere vnto thy ſelfe, then thou art to parents, or friends: and Charity requireth that thou loue them ſo, as thou do not thy ſelfe any ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al hurt for them. If then they trouble thee in Religion, and be a diſquiet vnto thee in my ſeruice, and any impediment and let alſo to thy ſpirituall profit, why ſhouldſt thou not forſake them? why ſhouldſt thou not get thy ſelfe far from them? Againe, art thou not to hate thoſe parents, who oppoſe themſelues againſt thee, and had rather haue thee to liue out of Religion? &amp; more then that, labour alſo to draw thee out of it, and to fly from them, as from the Diuels inſtruments, and workes? Thou muſt not hold him for father or friend, who ſeeketh to put thy ſoule in ieopardy of damnation.

What rule perſcribeth, that thou ſhouldſt play thy parents Procuratour?

                  <p n="5">5. It is to be confeſſed that tribulation is bitter, but it is ſuch bitternes, as is not il: neither can it be properly ill, becauſe it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from my heauenly Father, whoſe
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:15101:262"/>
goodnes is infinite, and leadeth to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme good, as it hath already brought all the bleſſed, that dwell now in heauen. And ſeeing I, the Sonne of God, was neuer without tribulation, it nothing beſeemeth a Religious man to refuſe it for the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that is therein. He, that hath for the loue of me once ſpoyled himſelfe of the pleaſures of this world, muſt in Religion ſeeke not the pleaſure of the ſenſes, but to pleaſe the taſt of his ſoule. For if I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the bitter cup of my paſſion, what a ſtate would that haue beene of thyne, and of mankind beſides? There are ſome, who thinke the affliction that they ſuffer, is ouermuch, yea and to exceed all the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and croſſes of the world. But it is nothing ſo, and more then that, by that conceit and opinion they greatly offend me, becauſe they imagine &amp; feigne me to be a cruel tyrant, who layeth more heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens vpon men, then their forces may beare. I am not ignorant, how much euery one is able to beare: I know alſo, what may pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

others calamityes or miſeryes, thinketh his owne greater then theirs.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When a man hath not in this life his part in affliction, and all things ſucceed vnto him as he would deſire, it is no good ſigne: for that whether he be iuſt, or be a ſinner, it is to be feared, that he is reſerued for ſome greater puniſhment, and that the proſperity of this life is graunted him for a reward onely of the good he hath done heere. When the ſicke perſons life is deſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, there is giuen him to taſte whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he ſhall deſire. But when a man hath his part in tribulations, it is a good ſigne. For if he be good, by tribulations he is made better, and as gold, the more it is purged, the more it ſhineth, and the more perfect it becommeth. If he be in the ſtate of ſinne, by tribulations he is awaked out of it, that he may remember himſelfe, and by ſight of his owne miſery looke about him, and repent. The Prodigall ſonne, when he was in his flouriſhing ſtate and in his proſperity, left his father, &amp; when for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune after turned her whele, and want and miſery oppreſſed him, ſeeing the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous ſtate wherein himſelfe liued, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home to his father. Tribulation oftentymes cauſeth vnderſtanding, when
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:15101:263"/>
proſperity bereaueth a man of it. How many be there, who becauſe they be not preſſed with any thing aduerſe, haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther layd aſide all remembrance of me, or ſhew themſelues like vnto thoſe, in whoſe affection and loue I haue very little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt? But when I ſhall but once ſend them the very leaſt ague, or any dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity or ſicknes, they forthwith come running vnto me, and cry aloud, Saue vs we periſh.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The neceſſity, that compelleth men to come vnto me, is healthfull, but yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of few, becauſe it is vnknowne. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be infirme, but they acknowledge not their infirmity, and though they know it, yet they know not what medicine is to be vſed for the remedying thereof. I am the domeſticall Phiſitian to Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and know exactly the complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all, as alſo the cauſes of their ſicknes, and make a medicine fitting for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and taking of them all away. Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is a medicine, which with the more patience it is receiued, the more effectuall and ſoueraigne is it to cure. This medicine by me preſcribed and willingly taken, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="483" facs="tcp:15101:263"/>
receiued, purgeth cleane the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of all the antedent indiſpoſitions and ſicknes. It is a property of this antid e to ſearch to the root of the euill, and to take it quite away, which is pride: in ſo much as by humblyng it cureth, and maketh the froward, angry, and terrible, as meeke as lambes. This medicine teacheth euery Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man, how much he hath profited in Religion, how ſolid he is in vertue, and how conioyned he is with me, his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and Redeemer. Finally tribulation worketh ſo, as whatſoeuer lyeth hid in the ſoule, whether it be vertue or vice, it layeth it open to the eye.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. There is another property of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that it preſerueth a man from future miſchiefs.

Such a one queſtionles ſhould be in great danger of his life. Correction is an healthfull medicine, though few there be that know it, and very few haue practiſe of it: but becauſe it is ſomewhat bitter and troubleſom, thereof it commeth, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

them, and to promote them much in ſpirit and in perfection. This medicine, as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, muſt be proportioned to the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of the infirmed perſon, and is to be giuen in tyme, when the humors be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and when the ſicke perſon ſhall be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at quiet, or leſſe troubled. And to the end the ſicke perſon may take it with a better will, he muſt firſt of all make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe capable of his euill, of the danger he findeth himſelfe in, and of the great eaſe he may receaue by the medicine.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Religion, that maketh no vſe of this ſort of remedy, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not long conſerue it ſelfe, and it is an exceeding great fault in the Superiour to forbeare to correct his ſubiects, and to permit them to liue at their owne will, for feare of diſpleaſing them. The ſicke, that liueth after his owne man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, becommeth rather worſe then amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Since the corruption by ſinne, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature is ſo inclined to euil, as if there be not an eye had to help and repaire it by admonition and correction, it will ſoone fall into ſome ruine, or other. O what an accompt ſhall Superiours haue to make, for feare of making themſelues hated, or for feare of diſcontenting, or for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther human reſpects, omit to correct their

inferiours. They ſhould perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that the defects of their ſubiects, which ſhould haue been amended by their correction, ſhal be imputed vnto them. But much worſe ſhall be the condition of the inferiours, who being admoniſhed by their Superiours, become troubled and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and do take the correction, which is ſo profitable and ſoueraigne a medicine, for an iniury done them: whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that being vnworthy thereof, they ceaſe not murmuring againſt their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: which is nothing els, but to murmure againſt me, whoſe will it was, that ſuch correction ſhould light vpon them. But what hope is there of amendement in ſuch perſons, when they become worſe, and add one fault to another? What good may be expected from them, when they will not acknowledge their fault, and eyther refuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. Tell me, my ſonne, whence is it, that thou art ſo troubled, &amp; ſo ſore moued, when thy Superiour blameth thee? Seeſt thou not, that ſo to do, is to take the knife

Seeſt thou not, that by ſo doing thou conuerteſt the medicine into poyſon, which I had ordained for thy good, and for the healing vp of thy wounds, and thy euill diſpoſition?

And what other thing is this, then to fauour thyne owne euill, and to refuſe cure?

For ſo to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, were to multiply debates and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to trouble &amp; diſturbe peace, to open a gate to much hatred and diſcords: and when I did in my Ghoſpell deliuer the manner of fraternall correction, I did not giue precepts or inſtructions of any ſuch manner of proceeding. It is a courſe both better, and more beſeeming the Religious man, to ouercome by way of Humility, then by way of debate, and contention. O how much haue ſome of my ſeruants gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and profited, who being reprehended by their Superiours, euen for ſome fault they had not done, receaued the reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as comming from me, and perſwaded that I was he who blamed them by the mouth of their Superiour, humbled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, without further debating the matter wherewith they were charged, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all to Gods prouidence craued par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, yea by ſo doing much edified their Superiour.

So the medicine may do thee good, to what end ſhouldſt thou trouble thy ſelfe, whether the potion be ſweet, or ſower? My ſonne, haſt thou a deſire to liue in peace? Leaue that, which concerneth thy Superiour, &amp; thinke of that alone, which toucheth thy ſelfe. To haue an eye to this, that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection be founded in Charity, that it be done without choller, &amp; without diſdaine, that it be proportioned to the fault, that it be done in tyme, that the inferiour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue that which is done, be done out of a deſire of his good, all this appertaineth to the Superiour, and not to the inferiour: but to haue a care, that the correction be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued humbly with patience, and a will to make his profit thereof, that toucheth the inferiour. But if the inferiour wil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert this order, and haue his eye rather v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the manner wherewith correction is to be done, then how he ought to admit it, it will not be well with him, no more then it would be with the Superiour, if he would haue an eye rather to the manner of taking correction well, then to giue it,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:15101:275"/>
in a manner fitting, and for the good of his ſubiects. He eaſily committeth an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who thinketh not often, and ſeriouſly on that, which concerneth and importeth him to do.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. My ſonne, if thou haſt a deſire to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, loue correction, for ſo much as it is a good &amp; aſſured meanes therunto. Thou knoweſt not thyne owne faults, or if thou doeſt, thou knoweſt them not, as thou ſhouldſt. Thou perceiueſt not how offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſiue they be to anothers eye, how is it then poſſible, thou ſhouldſt amend them? And correction is that, which giueth thee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and knowledge both of the one, and the other.

But it may be, that ſuch perſons thinke themſelues irreprehenſible, and be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of themſelues, that all they do, is well done, or that they are diſcontented to be reprehended by their equalls, though in the mean while they know wel inough, that themſelues are faulty. The one and the other cannot proceed of any thing but pride, and to ſay truly, he is ſuch a one, and of the number of thoſe Religious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who haue no will to practiſe either Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility or Mortification.

otherwiſe be imployed in profitable things and in good workes. For how much tyme doth a ſcrupulous man looſe in ſaying one prayer, or in reading of a pſalme? He begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againe and againe, he repeateth what he hath formerly ſayd, and neuer maketh an end, and which is worſe, when he hath all done, he remaineth leſſe ſatisfyed, then he was at the very firſt: and if it happen, that notwithſtanding all this, he maketh no more repetitions, it is rather in regard of a certaine yrkſomenes, and loathing he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, then out of any perſwaſion to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he hath ſatisfyed what he ſhould do. Againe the ſcrupulous doth not only looſe his tyme himſelfe, but he further cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the loſſe thereof to his Superiour, or to his Ghoſtly-father, with whome he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth touching his ſcruples, and if they yeald him the hearing, it will be long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he make an end, and the more a man condeſcendeth to a ſcrupulous perſon, the more and greater will be his hurt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Scruples make the ſcrupulous man ſtiffe and obſtinate: for where a vayne feare of offending, and of not ſatisfying predominateth &amp; beareth ouermuch ſway in him, thence it commeth, that he yeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not, nor obayeth very eaſily, and that
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:15101:279"/>
he will not condeſcende to his Ghoſtly Father, or Superiour, &amp; ſo he becommeth headſtrong, and euer retayneth theſe his ſcruples. Scruples cauſe the ſcrupulous man not to conſider his Creatour, as a good and louing Father, as he ſhould do, but as a ſeuere exactour, and a rigorous iudge of his actions: and this conſideration of his fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him with ſo many vayne feares, and ſo great, as he ſeemeth to himſelfe to be already in the very torments of hell. My ſonne, thou doſt very iniuriouſly to deale with me in this ſort: I haue not created thee for thy damnation, but for the glory of heauen, and I deſire nothing els, but thy good, and thy ſaluation. I haue for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of thee endured a thouſand paynes &amp; miſeryes all my life long, and therfore my will is, that thou bid adieu to this vaine feare, and that thou from henceforth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of me, as of a good, and mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, deſirous of thy ſoules good.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And if thou haſt a deſire to rid thy ſelfe of this malady, and not be ſcrupulous, there be three thinges for thee neceſſary. The firſt is, that thou be not thyne owne phiſitian, and be reſolued to giue credit to thyne owne aduiſe and iudgment. A Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, be he neuer ſo learned, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:15101:279"/>
is nothing fit to ordaine a medicine for himſefe, when he hath any ſicknes, and much leſſe ſhall the ſcrupulous man be fit: whoſe paſſion and imagination being ſtronger, and more vehement then any feuer, or paine or body, troubleth him in ſuch ſort, as it robbeth him of all his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and cauſeth him to ſee and take one thing for another.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The ſecond thing neceſſary, is, that thou follow the aduiſe of thy ſpiritual father, or of thy Superiour, though thou be otherwiſe of a contrary opinion. And to the end thou maiſt accommodate thy ſelfe with the more facility thereunto, thou muſt perſwade thy ſelfe, that I am he who gouerne the Religious in their ſcruples, and that I gouerne them by the mediation of their Superiours, and therefore thou muſt be perſwaded and hold for aſſured, that the counſaile, which they ſhall giue thee in thy ſcruples, commeth from me. And indeed I could not well deale with them in any other manner. For if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man haue, out of a deſire to ſerue me, forſaken both parents &amp; friends, very reaſonable it is, that I ſerue them alſo for father and mother, for kin and friends. If flying from the world, they haue caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:15101:280"/>
into my armes, reaſon it is, that I imbrace and receiue them, and ſerue them for their refuge. If they haue made their election to depend of me for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of themſelues all in all to my will, meete it is, that I aſſiſt them with my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and counſaile, and that they admit it, as comming from me, what they ſhall aduiſe them in that behalfe.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The third thing that thou muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, is, to obay thy ſayd ſpiritual Fathers; and to execute and do with a promptitude what they ſhall ſay, &amp; this is ſo neceſſary; as if it be not kept, all the reſt will not profit thee a whit. For what would it help to ordayne a medicine, and further to be perſwaded, that it is preſcribed by an excellent Phiſitian, if the patient and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme perſon will not vſe it? My ſonne, take heed of Sathan, who for the hindring of many of thy good workes ſeeketh to trouble thee with many ſcruples, and to fill thy head with infinite anxietyes, and vnſtayed and running thoughts. I know that he maketh thee anon to ſay, or thinke in thy mind, who knoweth whether my ſpirituall Father be not deceaued in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding me to do this, or leaue that? It may be, he hath not vnderſtood me, or that
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:15101:280"/>
I haue not ſufficiently explicated my ſelfe. I am in doubt, whether this counſaile which he giueth me, be not rather to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me: and which is more, that in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe he thinketh not, that I haue offended God, and that I ſhall be damned. All ſuch thoughts ariſe of a vaine and falſe feare cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the enemy, who troubleth the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for feare thou ſhouldſt ſee the truth. But ſeeſt thou not, that though thy ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Father ſhould deceiue thee, thou art not for all deceaued in obaying him, for that thou oughtſt to obay him in all thinges, where there is not apparence of any mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſinne. And more then that, to thinke that he hath not well vnderſtood thee, ought not to trouble thee, ſith it ought to be inough for thy ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if he ſay, that he hath vnderſtood thee well: for thou art bound to beleeue him. In like ſort, to thinke, that thou haſt offended me by thy ſcruples, and that I will damne thee for them, is a thing, that muſt be far remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from thy imagination. He that hath ſo many pledges and teſtimonyes of my loue and benignity, as thou haſt, hath a good occaſion to put his truſt in me. If thou haſt a firme purpoſe not to offend me, and rather to dye, then to commit a mortal
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:15101:281"/>
ſinne, this being a true ſigne of thy ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of my amity, wherefore feareſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>MY ſonne, I ſee thee ouer diligent and curious in ſearching out the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of noueltyes and ſtrang things of the world, wherein thou giueſt to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that thou haſt not yet giuen ouer thy affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; loue to it, in ſo much as thou art not yet wholy dead vnto it. If thou haſt ſo abandoned it, as thou ſhouldſt not haue
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:15101:282"/>
any thing to do with it, whence is it that curioſity maketh thee to inquire after what is therein done, and what is ſayd and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth? What haſt thou to know and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that, which concerneth thee not, and that bringeth not any good to thy ſoule, but domage rather? Thou haſt more then often tryed, that the news of the world which thou haſt heard, occurreth to thy mind in thy prayer, in the tyme of Maſſe, and other good exerciſes. How much better courſe did thoſe good Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites take, who becauſe they might not vnderſtand, or know what paſſed in the world, withdrew themſelues into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, and there hid themſelues in holes vnder the ground?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Curioſity, ſith it is an inordinate deſire to know, is reprehenſible, &amp; repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the rule of right reaſon, but much worſe is the roote whence it commeth. If a Religious perſon were well affected to matters diuine and ſpiritual, he would not be curious to ſearch into thinges humane, that touch him not at all. Curioſity ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ariſeth of the little affection, that men haue to the works of vertue, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it greatly importeth the Religious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at all tymes to haue imployement in ſome
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:15101:283"/>
profitable and commendable thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though the ſame be not inough to withdraw him wholy from curioſity. Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> as it is attractiue, it cauſeth a man oftenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to leaue euen profitable occupations, and therfore the Religious muſt not only buſy himſelfe in things of profit, and ſuch as agree with his profeſſion, but alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his mind and affection therunto, and ſo doing he ſhall ſhut vp? he dore againſt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> curioſity, and therewithall free himſelfe from many diſquiets and troubles of mind. But when curioſity is in the Religious man accompanyed with idlenes, or light imployments, then ſhe keepeth holy day, becauſe ſhe well knoweth how to find en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, when ſhe liſteth, being the property of idlenes to ſet open both his dores and windowes: &amp; ſhe no ſooner getteth in, but that ſhe forthwith ſetteth the ſenſes at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which be her meſſengers, and ſendeth them forth to ſearch out noueltyes, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> which ſhe afterwards cauſeth the inward powers of the ſoule to reflect, and to buyld their iudgments, and caſtles in the ayre wherby it appeareth, how much curioſity is repugnant to the Religious ſtate, which requireth that all the ſenſes be brought in ſubiection and mortifyed, and that they
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:15101:283"/>
haue not the liberty to wander where they ſhould not, and when it appertaineth vnto reaſon to guide, and direct them, and not curioſity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Marke my ſonne, the craft and policy of Sathan, whereby he induceth the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man to open the gate of curioſity. Firſt he putteth in his thoughts, that it is good for him to vnderſtand the diſaſters &amp; te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peſts of the world, to the end he may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto me the more condigne thanks for hauing a brought him into the quiet &amp; ſafe harbour of Religion: and to the end, that hauing a better &amp; more perfect knowledge of the ſiniſter, and miſerable euents of the world, he may the better vnderſtand the felicity of the ſtate whereunto he is called, and from how many troubles and dangers he is deliuered: finally to the end, ſayth he, he may haue a compaſſion, and be moued to pray for the poore of the world, who are ſo ſore oppreſſed, and afflicted in the world, as euery good Religious man is bound to do. But to take all this at the beſt, it is nothing els, but to deceiue vnder the apparence of good: and what is of it ſelfe vicious and bad, cannot be a meanes to the producing and doing of good workes.

                  <p n="3">3. O my ſoule, what ſhal we do heere!

Croſſe follow our ſweet Sauiour, who is our conductour and guide to true glory.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But tell me, my Sauiour, if thou haſt created me for glory euerlaſting, that is accompanyned with the greateſt glory and honour that can poſſibly be, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doſt thou forbid me to ſeeke after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and glory in this world? If thy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath left written, that he who deſireth a Biſhoprike, deſireth a good worke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould it not be lawful for me to deſire titles of honour?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. My ſonne, remember, that thou wert not created for an earthly glory, but for a celeſtial, &amp; none can hinder thee from purchaſing this. On the contrary, I am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed to ſee, that any ſhould buſy is mind with the glory of the world, for that of heauen. As touching that ſaying of my Apoſtle that thou alleadgeſt, thou muſt know, that to deſire a Biſhopricke, to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile &amp; take paines for the ſauing of ſoules, is a commendable thing, and an act of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: but to deſire it for the honour and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity that is annexed vnto it, or for the temporall commodity which a man may receaue thereby, is neither good, nor expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. In the primitiue Church the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprikes were without honour, and riches
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:15101:287"/>
and were accompanied with much paine and trauaile, in ſo much as he who deſired a Biſhoprike at that tyme, deſired by that occaſion to trauayle and take paynes in the Churches behalfe, and to become a martyr for my ſake: and therefore then to deſire to be a Biſhop, was a good and holy deſire. But ſince the time, that the Biſhopricks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to haue preheminences, honours, and riches annexed vnto them, ſuch a deſire cannot be without many dangers: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it commeth that my Apoſtle, to giue to vnderſtand, that it was not lawfull for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one to aſpire to ſuch dignityes, added preſently after, that a Biſhop muſt be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, not contentious, but ſober, chaſt, and charitable. Thus thou ſeeſt, my ſonne, that theſe dignities haue more bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, then honour, and thou ſhalt do a great matter, if thou canſt guide thyne owne ſoule without medling with the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of anothers. For if there ſhould not be any other thing beſids this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſay, that a Biſhop muſt be irreprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, it would be inough for the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of any man of meane iudgment.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Moreouer the difference, that is betweene him who beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth Religious, and him who taketh the charge of a Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prik,
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:15101:288"/>
manifeſteth the ſame. For he who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into Religion, entreth in for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of vertue and perfection, but a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop entreth into his charge to exerciſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and to teach vertue vnto others, not only by words, but much more by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of good life, and therefore he muſt euen then be perfect, and he muſt haue vertues not only in expectation and hope, but in effect alſo. My ſonne, ſuffer not thy ſelfe to be miſled, and abuſed by the enemy, when he putteth into thy head, that when thou ſhouldſt be promoted to any dignity or prelacy, or when thou ſhouldſt be a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, thou wouldſt ſerue me better, and wouldſt do many more and better good workes: for as much as in ſuch dignityes both the obligation bindeth more, and the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of falling be much greater in thoſe conditions, then in other. And if thou mayſt not acquire thy ſelfe in leſſer obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, how wilt thou diſcharge thy band in greater? If one little and light occaſion maketh thee to fall eaſily, what will it be in a greater? Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that it is a leſſe euill to fall from a low place, and that he muſt not preſume to take vpon his ſhoulders a great &amp; heauy burden, who ſeeth himſelfe apt to fall vnder a light one. But if thou
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:15101:288"/>
haſt a will not to be deceaued in this caſe, obſerue what I ſhall tell thee. Firſt neuer intrude, or preſent thy ſelfe to any dignity or prelacy: ſecondly neuer deſire nor ſeeke them, but rather ſhunne them, vnles thou be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded by him who may bind thee to accept them, or that the neceſſity were ſuch, as in the iudgment of thy ſpirituall Father, charity ſhould bind thee to admit them for the common good, and my grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeruice.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. A man may eaſily know by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertyes of Ambition, how repugnant it is to a Religious ſtate. There is not a vice that diſſembleth, or diſguſteth, as doth Ambition, and therof it proceadeth, that it is worthily called hipocriſies and adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations mother. Ambition, for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning of any office or dignity, maketh a ſemblance and ſhew, that it is poſſeſſed of many vertues, wherof it hath not the very leaſt part, or any thing at all. With how many colours ſetteth it forth her owne actions, to make them to be eſteemed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that it deſireth? To whome doth it not crouch, &amp; bow the knee, that it may haue audience, and treate with him, at whoſe hands it ſtandeth in hope of fauour? It euer liueth betweene feare and hope

He honoureth all the world, he maketh a thouſand promiſes to euery one, he maketh ſemblance of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all.

And to this purpoſe it will profit vs to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate and often to reuiew theſe points fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider firſt, my ſonne, how rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly God did puniſh the ſinnes, that were committed in the holy places: as in the perſon of Lucifer, who was for his pride thruſt out of heauen and caſt downe into hell: in the perſon of Adam &amp; Eue, whom he baniſhed out of the terreſtriall paradiſe for their diſobedience: in that of Dathan &amp; Abyron, whome the earth ſwallowed vp aliue: in that of Ananias &amp; Saphyra, who fell downe dead at S. Peters feet for lying vnto him. Conſider theſe examples, and feare thou alſo, leaſt he puniſh thee in body or ſoule, or at leaſt for the ſinnes thou haſt committed in Religion, he abandon thee cleane. Therefore make thou from hence forth this reſolution, &amp; firme purpoſe, that thou wilt keep all thy rules and lawes of Religion, for feare leaſt God lay his heauy
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:15101:291"/>
and rigorous hand vpon thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly conſider, what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſayth of the tree, that did not beare any fruit: Cut it down, to what end occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieth it place in the ground? He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to be cut down being againſt reaſon it ſhould take the place of another tree that would beare fruite. If our Sauiour would giue ſo rigorous a ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vpon an vnfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tree, what would he haue done, if it had borne fruit infectious, impoyſoning, and deadly? Thou art that barren tree, that in Religion doſt in vayne occupy the place of another that would ſerue God truely, and as it ſhould beſt beſeeme a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man. Thou art the vnfruitfull tree, that beareſt none, but the fruits of death, &amp; of many ſinnes: and for this thou haſt cauſe to feare, that God will with the axe cut thee down, &amp; remoue thee from the place, where he hath ſo mercifully ſet thee, and plant another for thee, who ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l ſerue him Religiouſly, and ſhall beare fruit to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting. Therefore my ſonne, read thy Rules often, obſerue them exactly, be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent in thy vocation, and endeauour to go forwards from one vertue to another, to the end our Lord may gather the fruit, that he deſireth, of thee, whome he hath by ſo
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:15101:292"/>
ſingular a priuiledge planted in the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of holy Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly conſider, that all the holy inſpirations, ſpirituall helps, and all the ordinances &amp; rules of Religion be giuen by God for this, that the Religious ſeeke to perfect themſelues in his ſeruice: and therfore thou muſt thinke, that doing the contrary, thou wrongeſt God, and iniureſt thy ſelfe very much, and haſt iuſt occaſion to feare, leaſt he will pronounce this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſaying, mentioned in his Prophet Eſay, againſt thee: In the Land of the Holy he hath done wicked things, and he ſhall not ſee the glory of our Lord. As though he ſhould ſay: I haue giuen thee a place, in an holy place, amongſt Holy ones, to the end thou ſhouldſt become like vnto them. I haue for the ſame end prouided thee of all poſſible commodityes, and ſo many good inſpirations, lawes, ordinances, and rules for thy better help, and the more perfecting of thee in my ſeruice, and all theſe helps thou haſt abuſed, and haſt been ſo far from profiting &amp; going forwards in my ſeruice, as thou art become worſe. And what will be the end of all this? Becauſe thou haſt abuſed al theſe helps that I haue giuen thee towards thy increaſe in vertue, thou ſhalt
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:15101:292"/>
not haue any part in my eternall glory.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly conſider, that the ſinne which is committed againſt any Vow is much greater, and diſpleaſeth God more then do other ſinnes. A Vow impoſeth a greater and ſtraiter obligation of ſeruing God, and therfore when the fault is made in that behalfe, the ſinne is the greater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. And more then this, thou muſt perſwade thy ſelfe, that al which thou vſeſt for thy meate and drinke, cloathing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, whether thou haſt it of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion wherof thou art an vnworthy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or otherwiſe by way of almes of well diſpoſed perſons, turneth to the ſinne of fraud, becauſe thou defraudeſt &amp; deceaueſt thy Religion on the one ſide, in not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the rules therof, and on the other ſide thou art vnworthy, and incapable to pray for them, who beſtow ſuch almes vpon thee. For our Lord vouchſafeth not to heare thy prayers, ſo long as thou ſhalt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to obſerue what thou haſt promiſed him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Laſtly conſider, how feruent and earneſt a deſire thou hadſt to ſerue God, when he did firſt call thee vnto Religion. And if euen now notwithſtanding thou be intangled in ſo many ſinnes, and affections
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:15101:293"/>
of the world, thou yet feeleſt in thy ſelf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and meanes of profiting to perfection, thou art ſo miſerable, cold, and negligent? And if thou anſwer me, that thou art indeed a grieuous ſinner, but thou entredſt into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be good, whence commeth it, that after ſo long tyme of thy being, &amp; of tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp in this ſchoole of vertue, thou ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt to be ſo far of from thy firſt deſires, and from that which appertayneth to thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion? And therfore my ſonne, be aſhamed that thou art ſo imperfect, &amp; make a firme reſolution to returne to thy firſt feruour, and to an exact obſeruation of thy rules, &amp; of thyne Inſtitute, that thou mayſt from this tyme forwards ſerue God in all loue, and holynes, as meet is thou ſhouldſt do.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Certaine Conſiderations, that may help to the obſeruing of the Rules in Religion.</head>
               <p>THE firſt is, to read them often, and to meditate the forementioned points euery moneth once, or more often, to the end by ſuch meditation thou mayſt ſtir vp in thy ſelfe a deſire of obſeruing them And to conceiue a firme purpoſe neuer to infring

or breake any Rule whatſoeuer, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that it importeth little, or is not of any conſequence, will help much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is, to deſire thy Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and all the other Religious perſons of the houſe to reprehend and admoniſh thee freely, as often as they ſhall ſee thee to tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. The third is euery, moneth to do ſome voluntary pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nance, either in ſecret, or in publique by the permiſſion of thy Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, for the faults that moneth commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the Rules, and good deſires and purpoſes that God hath inſpired thee with, accompayning it with a good deſire and firme reſolution to obſerue them better for the tyme to come.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth is, that thou haue a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affection to the obſeruation of thy foure vowes of Pouerty, Chaſtity, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Encloſure, keeping them with more care, then thou wouldſt moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>Of the vowes, which the Religious make and firſt of Obedience.</head>
               <p>THov muſt obey thy Superiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly for the loue of God, &amp; conſider that hauing the vertue of Obedience, thou ſhalt togeather with it haue the other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: and eſpecially for this, that by it our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour did redeeme the world, that was ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined by the contrary vice of diſobedience. And therfore ceaſe not to make petition to his diuine Maieſty, that he pleaſe to grant thee, to know and vnderſtand the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, merit, efficacy, and perfection of this vertue, that knowing it thou mayſt be the more ſtirred vp to plant it, and procure it to increaſe in thy ſoule.</p>
               <p>The Religious man that deſireth to be perfect in the vertue of Obedience, muſt be perſwaded, that the voice of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, when he or ſhe commaundeth any thing, is nothing els, but the very voyce of God, and when he vnderſtandeth the ſigne of doing any thing, he muſt thinke that it is God who calleth him.

The good &amp; obedient Religious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amineth not whether that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him, be well or ill commaunded, but obeyeth promptly, readily, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any murmuration in all thinges where there is not any manifeſt ſinne.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thy ſelfe with the only vſage of things that ſhall be vnto thee neceſſary, and to make a conſcience of vſing them as thyne owne, for feare leaſt vnder the colour of neceſſity thou become in tyme a Proprieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Therfore thou muſt not giue any thing vnto another without licence of thy Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, nor in like manner take any thing without leaue, though it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neceſſary. Thou muſt neuer haue any money at thyne own diſpoſition, whether it be in thyne owne hands, or in anothers, leaſt the Diuell deceaue thee, and vnder the pretence of neceſſity induce thee to violate

thy vow of Pouerty, and by ſo doing cauſe thee to incurre the danger of eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for not keeping thy promiſe made vnto God. And becauſe this vice of propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety is wont to raigne in the negligent, and careleſſe Religious, thou muſt marke cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine points, which may ſerue as antidots for the dryuing of this affection far from thyne hart.</p>
               <p>Conſider firſt, that this is a greater ſinne, then it is to caſt off the habit, or to go from one Couent to another, which yet is held for a very ſcandalous thing. It more importeth the Religious to keep the three eſſentiall Vowes thereof, and in particuler the vow of Pouerty, which is as the wall and rampier therof, then to weare ſuch an habit, or to liue in ſuch a monaſtery. If then it be ſo great a ſinne to returne to the habit of the world, and to caſt off that of Religion, or to runne from one monaſtery to another: what then thinke we, ſhall it be to vſe any thing as our owne, and to breake the vow of Pouerty, which conſerueth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in her integrity.</p>

For that which the Religious may gaine by her induſtry and paynes, or that which is giuen her, whatſoeuer it be, is not hers, but the communityes. And this theft is ſo much the greater, becauſe it is committed in that which appertayneth to the Church, to an holy place, to the poore, and to Gods ſeruants: and of this it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the ſinne of propriety is called ſacriledge, and conſequently worthy moſt grieuouſly to be puniſhed.</p>
               <p>Conſider thirdly, that the pretious ſtone, whereof our Sauiour maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Ghoſpel, is nothing but Pouerty, and that thou haſt bought it with the price of all thy goods, in forſaking Father and Mother, brethren and ſiſters, and all thyne other friends, all thy pleaſures &amp; commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dityes, and more then all this, thy owne ſelfe alſo. And draw out of this an holy confuſion, that thou giueſt all againe for a thing of nothing, which thou doeſt when thou vſeſt the things, that are giuen thee as though they were thy owne. Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thy owne fault herein, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that thou canſt not haue any greater treaſure, then holy Pouerty, for that in it

is found the Creatour, and Lord of all thinges.</p>
               <p>Conſider fourthly, how fooliſh and ill aduiſed that man ſhould be, who being eſcaped out of the dangers of the ſea, by the help of a good ſhip wherinto he had got himſelfe, he ſhould fill it with water by little and little: for ſo doing he ſhould in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion ſinke the ſhip, &amp; drown himſelfe withall.

               <head>Of the Ioy, which the Religious ought to make vpon the day of their Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and what ioy it ought to be vnto them.</head>
               <p>IT would be good to haue a particuler deuotion of thy Vows, that is to ſay, that euery yeare thou make a feſtiuity of the Day that thou didſt enter into Religion, and madeſt thy vowes. For as we euery yeare celebrate the day of the dedication of a materiall Church: ſo ought we in like manner, and with more iuſt reaſon keep ſolemne the day of the dedication of our Soule, which is the liuing Temple of the Maieſty diuine. And for the well effecting thereof, thou mayſt practiſe, and do theſe three thinges.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, thou muſt make a generall Confeſſion of all the yeare paſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the ſecond, thou muſt offer thy ſelfe anew to God, to ſerue him in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Pouerty, Chaſtity, Obedience, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure, being ſory for not hauing, for the tyme paſt, perfectly kept that which thou haſt promiſed him, and for hauing profited ſo meanely in vertue, and in his holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="552" facs="tcp:15101:298"/>3. Laſtly thou muſt take new hart, &amp; new forces, renewing thy holy purpoſes, and thy firſt deſires and feruours, returning to thy exerciſes intermitted, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring to perfect thy ſelfe in them. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou muſt ſee if thou canſt by the grace of God, find out any other meanes, more proper, and eaſy for helping of thee to put in execution all that which thou art to do, and in particuler thou muſt haue at al tyms this deſire to renew thy ſelfe in the vertue of prayer, and in the exerciſe of all other vertues. O how would this feſtiuity, and celebration of this thy Conuerſion, &amp; day of entring into Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haue profited thee, if thou hadſt done it as thou ſhouldſt. But thy own ſlouth and negligence hath beene an occaſion, that thou haſt omitted to vſe the meanes, and helps, that God hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foarded thee. And therefore pray thou inſtantly, that he would pleaſe to pardon thy paſſed faults, and to giue thee grace to do thy endeauour better for the tyme to come.</p>
